            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For why, who ſeeth not howe comberſome and perillous a ſtate they enter into, that take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to trauaile in the Wildernes in the night ſeaſon, without the helpe either of Moone or Starres, or any other light to direct them by? Goe they not oftentimes out of the way? Doe they not manye tymes ſtumble and ſtagger like men berefte of their ſenſes? Are they not euer and anone caughte in the Bryars, and there pitiouſly tattred and torne? Be they not like from time to time to run themſelues either againſte ſome Rocke, Blocke, or Tree ſtanding before them? wherby they get one while (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) a ſhrewde ruſhe on the ſides, an otherwhile a curſt thwacke ouerthwarte the ſhinnes, now and then a ſore bounſe on the breaſte, by and by a dreadefull duſte on the necke and ſhoulders, ſtraightwayes and odde
<pb facs="tcp:21011:3"/>blowe croſſe the face, and euen immediately an auke rap vpon the noſe, or ſome one daſh or other in the eies, eares, or teeth? But what are theſe in compariſon of the reſt? very fleabitings. For if they eſcape either with ſome or with all theſe hurts and annoyances which we haue now me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, they may ſay (and that truly) they haue played the tall fellowes. But ouer and beſides theſe, they light many tymes vppon ſome daungerous quagmire, foregrowne Lake or Pitte, wherein they ſticke faſte, and are not able to winde themſelues out againe, no not to the death. What ſhall I ſay of the huge multitude of Beaſtes ſo fierce and terrible in their kindes? Are they not like euery moment to be deuoured of them? Howe is it poſſible they ſhould eſcape ſo many roaring Lions, ſo many rauening Wolues, ſo many bloudy Beares, boy ſterous Bulles, cruell Tygres, Panters, Pardals, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardes, Serpentes, Dragons, and ſuche like, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a pray vnto them? I ſay nothing all this while of a daunger as greate as any other, namely, of the theeues and robbers, cormorants and caytifes, that lurke in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure places, gaping for the ſpoile of wayfaring men: of whom notwithſtanding they are cruelly rifled, and haue oftetimes their throates miſerably cut. But who is able to expreſſe all the harde happes and hazardes, whyche they throw themſelues into, that iourny by night in the Deſart (as is aforeſaide?) Verily I ſuppoſe not <hi>Syluanus</hi> hymſelfe. Nowe then if incace the ſtate of theſe menne be ſo difficulte and daungerous, that are in hazarde one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a bodily death: howe muche more perillous and pernitious is the caſe of all thoſe, that remaine in ſuche continuall ieopardy bothe of bodye and ſoule? Suche doubteleſſe is the plighte of all <hi>Adams</hi> children euen from the tyme of their byrth to the daye of their death. Such is the caſe and conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both of high and low, rich and poore, noble and baſe, bonde and free, Iewe and
<pb facs="tcp:21011:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Gentile, al and ſome, one and other. For why? ſo ſoone as wee are borne, we enter into thys worlde as into a huge Wilderneſſe: where we are efteſoones environed with innumerable ſtraites of the body, with innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perplexities of the ſoule. As touching the bodye, we come naked into the worlde, without either mantell to couer vs, or ſtrength to defende vs, or diſcretion to guide vs, or prouiſion to ſuccour vs: in whiche behalfe the very brute beaſtes do far-away ſurmount vs. And wee be no ſooner crawled foorth of our mothers womb, but wee ſette oute oure throates and crye: euen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bewraying bothe oure preſent miſery, and oure wretchedneſſe to come. As we growe vppe in yeares, ſo increaſe oure troubles. Troubles within vs, troubles withoute vs, troubles aboue vs, troubles beneath vs, troubles behinde vs, troubles before vs, troubles on the righte hande, troubles on the lefte, and euerye where troubles. Within vs, all manner of maladies and diſſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes proceedyng of inwarde cauſes, whyche in verye deede are ſo manye in number, as the verye Phiſitions themſelues coulde neuer as yet find oute propre names ynoughe for them, much leſſe preſcribe any ſitte reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to heale them. Without vs, all kinde of outwarde croſſes, and diſtreſſes: as hunger, thirſt, colde, nakednes, woundes, ſoares, botches, blaynes, blindeneſſe, lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, deafneſſe, dumbneſſe, perills of ſworde, perilles of fyre, perilles of water, &amp;c. Aboue vs are the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens (as yee woulde ſaye) armed againſte vs, the Firmament frownyng vppon vs, the Ayre diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, the Windes wraſtling, the Thunders roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, the Lightnings flaſhing, the Comettes and blazing Starres lowting, the Sunne eclipſed, the Moone depriued of hir light: and all tokens of calamities vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:21011:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Beneath vs is the earth oftetimes trembling and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, many times ſindged and ſcorched, diuers times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerflowen &amp; ſurrounded, ſometimes opening and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing vp all that euer is, not ſeldome times breathing out peſtilent vapours and exhalations, to the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whole Cities and Townes.

Yea, and which way ſoeuer we turne vs, troubles vppon troubles, trials vpon trials, one vexation vppon an other, and euen death it ſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually purſuing vs. And thus fareth it with vs as touchyng our bodies. But as concerning our ſoules, the caſe is ſo muche the more dangerous, as the enimies are pernitious, and calamities grieuous whervnto they are ſubiect. Subiect (I ſay) not by creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but by deprauatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or rather by originall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. For in deede if they be conſidered accordyng to that excellent nature, wherein they were firſt created before the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> it will appeare, that as in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſpirituall, and in qualitie immortall, ſo were they indued alſo with ſingular ornaments and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as whereby they reſembled the image euen of God himſelfe. But (alas) euer ſince that fatall ruine and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall decay of our great vnhappy graundfather <hi>Adam,</hi> they haue not onely bin depriued of all thoſe orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and graces which before they had, but alſo infected with contrary vices and deformities: ſo as in ſtedde of light, they are become darke: in ſtedde of pure, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obſcure: in ſtedde of holy, they are become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane: in ſtedde of vprighte, iuſt, perfit, happy, bleſſed, the image of the eternall God, they are become pieuiſh, peruerſe, vnperfect, vniuſt, accurſed, the Image of the infernall Sathan. And this forſooth generally is the ſtate wherein we ſtand both in reſpect of our ſoules and bodies. For the more manifeſt proofe wherof, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:21011:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>are plentifull, eſpecially where they painte foorth man in his naturall coloures, and ſet him vp (as it were) on a ſtage to be ſeene. For they teache, that there is no ſounde or whole parte in him from the crowne of the heade to the ſoale of the foote. For why?<note place="margin">

Not as though it were lawfull for anye man to cutte himſelfe ſhorte by vntimely death (as manye diuelliſhe and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate perſons doe) but to the intent to gette the maſtery ouer our affections, to bridle oure luſtes, to mortify oure olde man, to kill oure concupiſcence, to ſubdue oure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and finally, to ſubmit all our wil, wiſedome, reaſon, vnderſtanding, and all that euer we haue either within vs or without vs, to the rule and obedience of Gods holy Worde, and to the gouernment and direction of his holy Spirite. But I feare leaſte I haue exceeded alreadye the compaſſe of an Epiſtle: I will therefore bee as briefe as is poſsible.

Whiche godly diligence and indeuour as I wiſhe vnfainedly from my very hearte to be wrought effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in mine owne ſelfe: ſo make I mine humble prayers vnto the Lord, that he would vouchſafe in his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to kindle and ſtirre vppe the ſame in the heartes of all people, to awaken them out of the ſleepe of ſinne and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, to drawe them out of the dirty dregges of Popery and ſuperſtition, wherein Sathan hath of long tyme, and yet ſtill keepeth a great number to ſcatter the cloudes and miſtes as well of all olde as newe ſprung vp hereſies from amongeſt them, and laſte of al, ſo to ioyne and knit them togyther in one conſent of the truth of his holy word and Sacraments, as may be moſte of all to the aduancement of his glorious kingdome, and to the vtter ouerthrowe of Sathans outrage and Tyranny. To the furtherance wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of bicauſe I was perſwaded that this Booke of the famous and worthy man <hi>Andrew Hyperius</hi> woulde not a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, I thought it not amiſſe for my good brethren and Countrimens cauſe, to turne the ſame into oure common language, and to publiſh it in as plaine a ſtile and phraſe as I poſsibly coulde. Whyche being attentiuely read and
<pb facs="tcp:21011:8"/>pervſed, wil miniſter I am ſure, not onely ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the godly and Chriſtian Reader to work vpon, but alſo ſounde and ſubſtantiall reaſons to the ſatiſfaction of al indifferent mindes, and to the confuſion of all ſcorners and cauillers whatſoeuer. And forſomuche as I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant what great and ſpeciall bleſsings of hys Spirite the Lord in mercy hath vouchſafed to beſtowe vppon youre Ladiſhip, and vpon your progenie, whereby you are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againe by apparant teſtimonies, to expreſſe the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue and zeale whiche you beare to his infallible truth and Goſpell: I determined with my ſelfe amongſt many other noble and worthy perſonages, to make my ſpeciall choice of youre L. as a meete patroneſſe of thys preſent worke, and of my trauel and paines taken therein. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto I was prouoked ſo muche the rather, by cauſe that as you youre ſelfe are an earneſt traueller in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as well by publike hearing as by priuate reading, ſo your example wil not a little help both to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending of this worke vnto poſteritie, &amp; alſo to the incouraging of many other of youre ſexe and calling to the following of your ſteppes. Albeit I muſt confeſſe one other cauſe there was of this my doing, which I wil by no meanes conceale from your L. And that was the greate curteſie and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affabilitie, which amongſt many other vertues I noted in youre L. at what time you vſed commonly to reſorte vnto oure pariſhe Churche, to the exerciſe there. But then eſpecially appeared your curteſie moſt excellent in mine eie, when you of your owne accorde, to my great and ſingular rrioycing, vouchedſafe to viſite and adorne my poore houſe with your preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and to take wel in worth that ſimple entertainement, whiche then, throughe Gods goodneſſe, I was able to giue you. And euen then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe conceiued I this imagination with my ſelfe, that how ſoeuer you ſhould be forgetfull of your friendlineſſe offered, yet I for my part could neuer be vnmindefull of your
<pb facs="tcp:21011:8"/>curteſy receyued: but woulde teſtifye the ſame by one meanes or other ſo ſoone as time and oportunitie ſhoulde ſerue.</p>
            <p>Thus (Madam) haue you hearde the principall cauſes that moued mee to putte forth this Booke vnder the title of youre name: whiche, if I may perceiue your L. to take in good parte (as I doubte not but you will) then haue I reaped the onely guerdon of my deſire.

This is eternal life, that they know thee to be the onely true GOD, and whome thou haſt ſent IESVS CHRIST.</hi> But now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth this thing to be diſcuſſed, will ſome man ſay, to witte, from whence we haue to fette the knowledge of <hi>GOD</hi> the Father, and of his ſonne <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and from whence we may readily learne, how <hi>GOD</hi> will be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped of vs. This matter is eaſily anſwered and
<pb facs="tcp:21011:11"/>determyned. And ſoothly it is beſt for vs in thys behalfe to heare men inſpired with the ſpirite of <hi>GOD,</hi> rather than any other elſe whatſoeuer. Therefore the authour of the <hi>19.</hi> Pſalme, would haue vs to flee to the very law, and teſtimonie vttered by <hi>GOD</hi> himſelfe: <hi>The Lawe of the Lord,</hi> ſayth he <hi>is vndefiled, conuerting the ſoule: the teſtimonie of the Lorde is ſure, and giueth wiſedome to the ſimple. The ſtatutes of the Lord are right, reioycing the hearte: the commaundement of the Lord is pure, and giueth light vnto the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for euer: the iudgements of the Lorde are true, and righteous altogither. More to be deſired are they than golde, yea than muche fine gold: ſweeter alſo than hony, and the hony combe. Moreouer by them is thy ſeruaunt taught, and in keeping of them there is great rewarde.</hi> Many things ſpoken to this effect in the <hi>119.</hi> Pſalme, I purpoſelye paſſe ouer. In Eſay Chap. <hi>8.</hi> Whoſoeuer, by <hi>GODS</hi> diſpoſition, do offer themſelues vnto <hi>CHRIST</hi> to be taught as being deſirous to learne the trueth, are commaunded to reſort for councel to the lawe and to the teſtimony. And he, whoſe integritie is renoumed in the Sermons of the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles, I meane <hi>Abraham</hi> the common father of all the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Luke. <hi>16.</hi> to thoſe that are carefull to prouide and foreſée, leaſt they fall into endleſſe paines and torments, giueth in charge, that they heare attentiuely <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophetes. Laſt of all, <hi>CHRIST</hi> ſpeaketh expreſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye <hi>Iohn. 5.</hi> ſaying: <hi>Searche the Scriptures: for they are that teſtify of mee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the matter is brought to this pointe: that ſo many Kings and Princes as are deſirous to rouze vp men to the purchaſing of the knowledge of the true and euerlyuing <hi>GOD,</hi> and of hys ſonne <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> and to bring them home to a ſounde and ſincere religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, haue néede eſpeciallye (for manye greate cauſes and
<pb facs="tcp:21011:12"/>conſiderations) to become authours themſelues vnto all their ſubiectes, and euen to as manye as they maye, that they and euery of them to the vttermoſt of their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer maye applye their diligence continuallye to the reading, hearing, examining, and meditating of the holy Scriptures. Other waye than this, wherein a man might walke ſafely as in reſpecte of knowing the true <hi>GOD</hi> and of puchaſing ſaluation, without feare of erroure or anye other daunger, can none be ſhewed. And vndoubtedly this buſineſſe is in it ſelf of ſuch great excellencie &amp; dignitie, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is a thing well worthy wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſtian Kings and Princes ſhoulde by a ſpeciall regarde make decrées in their publike edictes and actes of Parliament.</p>
            <p>Neyther in verye déede are they ignoraunt, how it is the moſte ſage and ſacred commaundemente of <hi>GOD</hi> himſelfe, that ſo manye as are deſirous to bée enrolled and regiſtred in the bleſſed <hi>Common weale</hi> and Citie of <hi>GOD,</hi> ſhoulde continuallye exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in learning and meditating the lawe of <hi>GOD,</hi> that is to ſaye, the holy Scripture. <hi>Theſe words whiche I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund thee this day</hi> (ſayth <hi>GOD</hi> alwayes our moſt noble Emperoure, Deutronomie. <hi>6.</hi>) <hi>ſhall be in thyne hearte: and thou ſhalte rehearſe them continually to thy children, and ſhalte talke of them, when thou tarieſt in thy houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the waye, when thou lyeſt downe, and when thou riſeſt vp.</hi> Which decrée we finde to be repeated in the <hi>11.</hi> Chapter of the ſame Booke, that euen hereby it may be apparant, that it is a matter very earneſtly vrged of <hi>GOD.</hi> Wherfore if Chriſtian Magiſtrates doe at any tyme make lawes for theyr people, wherein they ſhall no leſſe ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye than grauelye commaunde, that all and euerye houſeholder and gouernours of familyes ſhall daylye in theyr ſeuerall houſes ordinarilye reade, heare, and

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ent ordinaunce and decrée, euen of <hi>GOD</hi> hymſelfe, by whoſe grace and fauoure they ſo ofte confeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be aduaunced to theyr hyghe and moſte honourable eſtate. And in good ſooth if Magiſtrats woulde duely conſider with themſelues by howe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne an othe, and for howe manye cauſes they are bounde and beholden vnto <hi>GOD:</hi> againe, if they woulde call to minde, howe néedefull a thyng it were, eſpeciallye in theſe dayes, for all menne to bée trayned vppe in the doctrine of true Religion: and beſydes, howe manyfolde commodities myghte by this moſte holeſome enterpriſe redounde vnto all eſtates: they coulde by no meanes abyde, to be counted ſlacke or negligente in thys behalfe. But rather they woulde wyth all godlye care, and ſo long time putte foorth Lawes touching the reading and meditation of the Scriptures, vntyll they ſhoulde ſée menne to bée more in loue with Diuine matters, than nowe they are, to profitte ſomewhat like in the Doctrine of Fayth and Chriſtianitie, and to amende their manners whyche we ſée nowe euerye where (oh vnhappye age of ours) to be ouermuche corrupted, and plainely abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.</p>
            <p>And queſtionleſſe, it becommeth Magiſtrates wyth greate courage and conſtancye to goe forwards in thys office: for ſo muche as they vnderſtande that it is euen by name enioyned vnto them alſo of <hi>GOD,</hi> that they ſhoulde continuallye be occupyed in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng the ſacréed Bookes. For thus doeth <hi>GOD</hi> the ſupreme lawgiuer, Deutronomie <hi>17.</hi> ſay vnto them:
<pb facs="tcp:21011:13"/>
               <hi>When the king ſhall ſitte vpon the throne of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then ſhall he write him a copie of this Lawe in a booke by the Prieſtes of the Leuites: and ye ſhal be with him, and hee ſhall reade therein all the dayes of his life, that he maye learne to feare the Lorde his GOD, and to keepe al the wordes of this Lawe, and theſe ordinaunces, for to doe them. That his hearte bee not lifted vp aboue his brethren, and that he turne not from the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente, to the right hande or to the lefte, but that hee maye prolong his dayes in his kingdome, hee and hys ſonnes in the middeſt of Iſraell.</hi> They then are more groſely deceiued, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhal néed with any long pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe to be confuted, whoſoeuer they be that imagine this commaundement to belong in no wiſe vnto Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Magiſtrates. Certaine it is, that as well y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king as all other Magiſtrates in generall are appointed of <hi>GOD,</hi> whom it happeneth at anye time to be placed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a multitude, that acknowledgeth the lawe and the Prophetes, that is to ſay, the pure and ſincere religion frée from all ſtaine of ſuperſtition. And that this precept maye rightly be tranſferred to all poſteritie that ſhould at leaſte imbrace the ſelfeſame religion, this maye bée an Argument, that <hi>GOD</hi> did then gyue it forth, when as the <hi>common Wealth</hi> of the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> had not as yet any king.</p>
            <p>Nowe this is alſo out of all queſtion, that lawes both maye and oughte to be made of Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, whyche ſhoulde not only approche moſte néere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the lawes of <hi>GOD,</hi> but alſo be as proppes and ſtayes alwayes in a readineſſe, to ayde, helpe, and aſſiſte by al meanes poſſible, menne as yée would ſaye otherwiſe weake, wearie, and almoſte fainting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their burthens, to the kéeping and obſeruation of them. Wherefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in hys ſeconde Booke <hi>Chap. 58.</hi> againſte the letters of <hi>Petilian</hi> the <hi>Donatiſt</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21011:13"/>wittily ſayeth, <hi>If lawes of earthly gouernement take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the ſuccour of the Churche, whiche is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, that thing is not to be found fault with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: ſeeing Paule the Apoſtle by the helpe of mans lawes defended himſelfe againſt his enimies.</hi> No leſſe fitly and to the purpoſe in his Epiſtle <hi>48.</hi> to <hi>Vincentius: yea in deed,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>the Kings of the earth do ſerue CHRIST, when they make lawes for CHRIST.</hi> Finally in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle <hi>50.</hi> to <hi>Boniface</hi> the Earle, he ſayth: <hi>The king ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the Lorde in feare: but one way in that he is a man, and another way in that he is a king. In that he is a man, he ſerueth him by liuing faythfully: and in that hee is a king, he ſerueth him by conſtituting lawes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding iuſt things, and forbidding the contrarie. As Ezechias ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, in diſtroying the Idol groues and temples, and thoſe hye places whyche were erected againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of GOD. As Ioſias ſerued him, he alſo by doing the like. As the king of the Niniuites ſerued hym, in compelling the whole Citie to pacify the Lorde. As Darius ſerued him, in giuing the Idoll into the power of Daniell to be broken, and in thruſting his enimies to the Lions As Nabuchodonoſor ſerued him, in forbidding by a terrible lawe all that were in his kingdome from blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming of GOD. In this therefore doe kings ſerue the Lorde, ſo farforth as they are kings, when they doe thoſe things to ſerue him, which none can do but Kings.</hi> Thus much ſayth he. That the firſt and principall care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Chriſtian kings and Princes ought to be beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, in and about the eſtabliſhing of lawes, which may be of ſome importaunce to the ſpreading abroade, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating, and maintayning of religion, no man thoughe neuer ſo rude and vnciuil can deny.</p>
            <p>Neyther doth the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> diſſemble this matter, <hi>in Nouellis, constitutione. <hi>6.</hi>
               </hi> to <hi>Epiphanius</hi> the Archbiſhop and Patriarke of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> writing
<pb facs="tcp:21011:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>in thys manner: <hi>The greateſt giftes that GOD of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine clemencie hath giuen vnto men, are, the Prieſthood &amp; Imperial gouernemente: wherof the one miniſtring in diuine matters, and the other ruling with dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in humayne, eyther of them proceeding from one and the ſelfe ſame beginning, do beautifye and adorne mans life. And therefore ſhall Emperours prouide for nothing ſo muche, as for the honeſtie of Prieſtes, ſeeing perdie that they alſo doe praye alwayes vnto GOD for them. For if that truely be blameleſſe on euery ſide, and faithful to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes GOD, and the Empire diligent in adorning the Common weale committed vnto it: then will there bee a certaine happy harmonie betwixt them, yeelding all things profytable vnto mankinde.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that wee haue ſo greate a care aboute GODS true religion, and about the honeſtie of the Prieſtes.

<pb facs="tcp:21011:15"/>and to be brought to ſome thriftineſſe, then he that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth no ſuche matter, but hangeth onely vppon the bare name of religion, and cleaueth therevnto as to a holy ancker, and ſuppoſeth the knowledge of GOD to conſiſt only in the bare name of the ſect.</hi> Thys lawe the Emperour commaunded to be openly proclaymed by <hi>Ariobindus</hi> his Liuetenaunte, and other officers: and ſo many as woulde not obey it, to forfayte all their goods, and to goe into exile. But if thys moſte holy Emperour was carefull, to determyne, in what tong the Iewes (who at that time as touching that matter contended very odiouſly among themſelues) ſhould read y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holye Scripture: why ſhoulde not our kings &amp; Princes prouide by Lawes, firſte, that all Chriſtians vnder theyr Dominions maye reade, then nexte in what tongue they maye reade the ſacred Byble, not ſo muche publikely in Churches as priuatelye in their houſes? And what ſhall we ſay of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſeconde, who (as the reporte goeth) (and no doubte moued by the commaundement of <hi>GOD,</hi> whyche is extante as touching Kinges, Deutronomie. <hi>17.</hi>) wrote out with hys owne hande the Bookes of the Newe Teſtamente, reade euerye mornyng in hys houſe ſome parte of them, and recyted cuſtomarily certaine Pſalmes and prayers togither wyth hys wife (ſhée was <hi>Eudocia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Leontius</hi> a Philoſopher of <hi>Athens,</hi> of whome they ſay were written right lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Poems) and with his ſiſters.</p>
            <p>But if I ſhoulde go aboute to produce moe proues tending to thys ende, I feare leaſte I ſhoulde incurre offence, who eſpeciallye haue excéeded alreadye the compaſſe of an Epiſtle. Therefore that my ſpeache maye drawe to an ende, I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded verylye that it wyll then goe well wyth the Church, and with the whole common wealth, when as
<pb facs="tcp:21011:15"/>the Kings, Princes, and all other Magiſtrates of theſe our times, ſeriouſly turning their minds to the Statutes of the Almighty and euerliuing <hi>GOD,</hi> whiche were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed euen nowe out of Deuteronomie, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the moſt noble Emperoures, of whome wee haue ſpoken, ſhall beginne to putte forthe, and with all godly diligence, to commend vnto the people committed to their charge, lawes, as touching the dayly and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall (and that perdie in their owne Countrey lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) reading, hearing, and meditating of the holye Bible. And as for the reaſons wherewith men may bée moued to obey their moſt holeſome lawes and decrées, I haue in this volume, partly out of the moſt ſacred Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Prophets and Apoſtles, partly, out of the Commentaries of the moſt excellent Doctors, packed togither, as ye would ſay in one bundle, very many, and the ſame not to be miſliked: ſo that this onely remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, namely, that with what willingneſſe and deſire they are of me offered, with the ſelfe ſame, all menne, whenſoeuer they ſhall reade them, woulde vouchſafe to receyue them. My purpoſe and ſcope to diſpatche it in a worde, is, to profite at leaſtwiſe ſomewhat by my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour all ſortes of men that are carefull for a better life, and for the euerlaſting ſaluation of their ſoules. But vnto your highneſſe moſt noble Prince, I haue thought good to conſecrate this worke, as well for ſundry cauſes and conſiderations, as alſo eſpecially for twayne, which haue in them more force than the reſt. The one is, when I behold and conſider the iuſtice, clemencie, gentleneſſe, and other vertues naturally ingenerate in you, togither with the notable education and inſtruction worthy a moſt famous Prince, doubtleſſe I am perſwaded, that your Highneſſe may eaſilie be broughte to this poynte, namely, that you will not onely exerciſe your ſelfe dayly in the reading of the holye Byble, according to <hi>GODS</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:21011:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>commaundemente Deuteronomie. <hi>17.</hi> but alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke and ſtirre vp one whyle by gentle exhortations, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother while by ſharpe and ſeuere preceptes, all the people and inhabitantes of youre Dominion (as <hi>GOD</hi> alſo hath willed, Deuteronomie, <hi>6.</hi> and. <hi>11.</hi>) to the doing and practiſing of the like. For what ſhoulde not I looke for at his hands, whoſe father <hi>Friderike,</hi> Prince Elector <hi>Palatine,</hi> and thoſe twayne of the ſame houſe, neuer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prayſed, ſupplying before hym the ſelfeſame honoures to theyr inneſtimable commendation, I meane <hi>Fridericke,</hi> and <hi>Otho Henry,</hi> haue accompliſhed many difficulte attempts, for the amplifying of <hi>GODS</hi> glory, and encreaſe of ſincere Religion. Neyther haue I anye doubte, but that youre Highneſſe moſt noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cauſed therefore of late the Bookes of the Diuine Oracles, moſt cléerely, and at his greate charge to bée Printed in the vulgar tong, to the intente, that both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Copies myght be conueyed and ſpredde ouer all youre Dominions and other places, and alſo be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoutely redde of euery man for conſcience ſake in theyr priuate houſes. The other cauſe is, ſo ſoone as other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates ſhall perceyue you, whoſe glory ſtandeth aloft on a high and ſtately place, to gyue ſome onſet to the trayning of Chriſtian people to the reading and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of the holy Scriptures: it is very lykely, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatelye therevppon many of them (that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie) wyll ſtoutely followe in the ſelfeſame rare of godlyneſſe. It happeneth, I wote not how, that the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whiche procéedeth from Princes and greate men, caſteth forthe farre and néere an incredible brighteneſſe, and as yée would ſay, beames, whereby it both rouzeth vp a great number, and alſo allureth them to mutation. And euen as wittie Paynters doe chooſe out all the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fauouredſt bodyes they can come by, and do lay to gette Tables that haue bin aforehande curiouſly wroughte
<pb facs="tcp:21011:16"/>by the cunningeſt Artificers of their occupation, to the intente they may drawe forthe and expreſſe them wyth theyr pencill and couloures: ſo likewiſe, ſuche men as are of a noble courage, and eſpecially of an honourable ſtocke and Parentage, do much more willingly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirouſly learne vertue of their equals, than of anye other ſortes of men beſydes whatſoeuer. Wherefore, I moſt humbly pray and beſéech youre Highneſſe, to take well in worth my good wyll and meaning héerein. The King euerlaſting, immortall, inuiſible, and <hi>GOD,</hi> onely wiſe, vnto whome alone all honour and glory is due, vouchſafe through <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> his ſonne, to informe your mind with his holy Spirite to good gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to guide and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende you to the ende.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll doe agree in this, that Man differeth from other Creatures in vnderſtanding and reaſon. But if we ſhall procéede further, and enquire wherein a Chriſtian &amp; God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man may be diſcerned from an vnchriſtian and vngodly man, verily I do not ſee what fitter aunſwere may be made, than in the knowledge if <hi>GOD,</hi> and in the ſtudie of accompliſhing his will. For as touching the wicked and vngodly man, eyther hee is altogither ignorante of <hi>GOD</hi> his maker and Creator, and vtterly voyde of the knowledge of his wil: for elſe, if he can giue any iudgement thereof at all, yet is he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (in the meane time) with no deſire of perfourming, or accompliſhing of it. But (vndoubtedly) it is requiſite, that the true Chriſtian do excell in both, that is to ſaye, not onely in knowledge, but alſo in holy actions of life and conuerſation, ſo farre forth as is poſſible. Howbeit, the knowledge of <hi>GOD,</hi> and of his diuine will, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man can not from anye other where, eyther more certaynely, or plentifully atteyne vnto, than out of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21011:18"/>word of <hi>GOD</hi> it ſelfe, whiche by the Prophetes and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, is faithfully committed to writing, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed ouer to poſteritie. For it pleaſed <hi>GOD,</hi> that hys will béeyng cléerely expreſſed, ſhould remayne extant in a fewe Bookes, to the whyche man, (béeing otherwyſe compaſſed about on euerie ſyde with the Cloudes of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance) ſo ofte as he coueteth to knowe what is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to <hi>GOD,</hi> mighte (as vnto a Cheſt full of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of precious iewels) haue recourſe, to draw out from thence, whatſoeuer is wholeſome and profitable for hym; for in déede, of the Bookes of holy Scripture, it may woorthely bée ſayde, that in them are layde vp and conteyned all the treaſures of wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, euen ſo much, and ſo manyfolde in effecte, as maye bée had of <hi>GOD</hi> in this life.

For where ſhall a man fynde one amongſt a greate number, that hathe thoſe holy Bookes at home in hys houſe? and if it be ſo that ſome haue them, yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye bée there of them can ſay, that they haue reade them ouer at any tyme or tymes in all theyr lyues?

Which thing alſo the Apoſtle Rom. <hi>1.</hi> concealed not. <hi>For as much,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>as that which maye be knowen of GOD, is manifeſt to them: for GOD hath ſhewed it vnto them. For the inuiſible things of hym, that is, his eternall power and godheade, are ſeene by the creation of the world, being conſidered in his works, to the intente that they ſhoulde be without excuſe.</hi> And how many and wayghtie points and principles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are expreſſed in the holye Scriptures, by ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, compariſions, and other ſuche like proues verye fitlye deriued from the nature and propertie of thyngs? Truelye the whole Booke of <hi>Iob,</hi> a good parte of the Pſalmes, and very manye of the Sermons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, of Chriſte, and the Apoſtles are full of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>Therefore <hi>Antonius,</hi> an Hermite of the wilderneſſe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as we read in the <hi>Tripartite</hi> Hiſtorie, booke <hi>8.</hi> chap. <hi>1.</hi> when on a time a certaine Philoſopher demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, howe he coulde attaine to contemplation

               </p>
               <p>Long before this <hi>Antony, Clemens, Alexandrnus,</hi> lib. <hi>6.</hi> Stromat. defined, that the creation of the worlde was the Scripture of <hi>GOD:</hi> and that the preceptes of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> was promulgate, and might be reade e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the workes of nature. With theſe agréeth <hi>Sainct Chriſoſtome</hi> in his <hi>7.</hi> homily vppon the former Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> again in two other Homilies, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one is entituled <hi>Of faſting, and of the reading of Geneſis,</hi> the other is accounted the <hi>9. To the people of Antioche.</hi> But it pertayneth not to our purpoſe at thys preſente, to vſe anye further entreatye as touching this booke: it is ynough to haue ſhewed in this order, that al men, at all times when ſo euer they beholde this world and the moſt beautiful partes thereof, ought reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly to meditate of <hi>GOD</hi> and of things belongyng vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> and ſo to take occaſion both of well thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and of well doing. As for thoſe in the meane time, in whome appeareth a greater force &amp; ſharpneſſe of witte than in others, we both exhorte and alſo louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye beſéeche them, to beſtowe a further diligence in ſearching the natures of thyngs. And that, not onlye bycauſe thys kynde of Phyloſophye procureth a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine honeſte pleaſure and delectation: but much more, for that when they haue once founde out the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full force and operation of anye thyng, they maye adore and extoll wyth prayſe, the greate power and Wiſdome of <hi>GOD,</hi> of whome ſuch thyngs are created: moreouer, they maye quicken theyr Fayth,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21011:21"/>and hope in <hi>GOD,</hi> conſidering that all things are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for our behoofe, and that all things neceſſarye for the ſuſtentation of our weakeneſſe, ſhall neuer at any time be wanting vnto vs. Laſt of al, they may diſcrete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe the things that are lawfull, and giue thankes vnto <hi>GOD</hi> for them. Vnto theſe thrée endes (as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſcope or marke to ayme at) ſhall the ſtudious of naturall Phyloſophye alwayes haue regarde: vſing in the meane ſeaſon euerye where thys caution or foreſight, namely, that the Creatures be in no wiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Creator: In whyche one poynte, <hi>GOD</hi> the Creator (as witneſſeth the Apoſtle Paule Rom. <hi>1.</hi>) ſhoulde be diſhonoured with a moſte ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deſpight. Wyth thys iudgemente, who ſo euer ſhall haue ſtudiouſlye enſearched the natures and propertyes of thynges, hée vndoubtedlye may bée eſtéemed to haue (and that not a little) profited in the Booke of Nature, and to haue well deſerued the prayſe and worthye commendation of a diligente Scholler.</p>
               <p>As touching the other Booke, that is to ſaye,<note place="margin">Of the later booke, to wit, the holy Scripture.</note> the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> or the holye Scripture, wée haue eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye at thys tyme to entreate. And that it is rightelye tearmed a Booke, it maye appeare by this, that <hi>GOD</hi> thoughte it not ynoughe by anye kynde of waye (howſoeuer it were) to publiſhe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme hys worde: but he prouided eſpecially by his wonderfull prouidence, that the ſame ſhoulde be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing, and ſo commended to euerlaſting memorye. For <hi>GOD</hi> him ſelfe wyth hys owne finger wrote his Lawe, in two tables of ſtone, and then commaunded that by <hi>Moyſes</hi> and the reſte of the Prophetes, hys ſayings and doings ſhoulde be putte in wryting: Exodus. <hi>17.24.34.</hi> Deutronomie <hi>6.31.</hi> Ioſue. <hi>24.</hi> Ieremie. <hi>36.</hi> Pſalme. <hi>102.</hi> By theſe what

For it is out of all doubte and controuerſie, that whatſoeuer is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the whole bodye of the Canonicall bookes, is the verye true and healthſome worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and putte forthe by his commaundemente. <hi>All Scripture,</hi> ſayeth the Apoſtle. <hi>2.

Whyche things ſéeing they are ſo, we doe with greate cauſe vehementlye ſpeake in the commendation of thys Booke, not in reſpecte of the paper or parchmente, and of thys or that tongue, or of one kinde of letter

               <p>Nowe there be thrée ſpecial cauſes, why we ſhoulde beſtowe more diligence in pervſing this latter Booke, than the former:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIRST:</hi> Greater is the dignitie of <hi>GODS</hi> word, than of the whole worlde.<note place="margin">VVe muſt giue more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendaunce to the latter booke of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than to the former: and that for three cauſes.</note> The world in déede was created of the ſame, that the word came from, which we ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commende: and eyther Booke is indifferentely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Booke of <hi>GOD</hi> yet neuertheleſſe the latter excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, for ſo much as wée finde recyted in it the ſelfe ſame worde, that <hi>GOD</hi> vſed, when he made the worlde of nothing. For we reade: <hi>GOD ſayde, Let there bee light, and the lighte was made.</hi> Againe: <hi>God ſayde, Let there be a firmamente, and there was made a firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> and ſo forth of other things. And whereas by the former Booke, we perceyue onely that there is a worlde: by the latter we maye perceyue, what was before the worlde, and from whence, and by what meanes the ſame tooke beginning. Therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we were neuer able to aſpire in ſearching of cauſes by the conducte of naturall reaſon, thyther are wée broughte by Faith, whyche Faith is intentiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye fixed on the worde of <hi>GOD</hi> reuealed, read, or harde.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21011:23"/>
                  <hi>For Faith commeth by hearing of the worde: and by Faith wee vnderſtande that the worlde was orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned throughe the worde of GOD, ſo that the thyngs which are ſeene, were made of things that appeared not. Rom. 10. Heb. 11.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SECONDLY:</hi> Whatſoeuer thyngs are neceſſary to be knowen as touching the will of <hi>GOD</hi> and oure ſaluation, are clearelye and expreſlye declared in the written worde of <hi>GOD:</hi> but howe farre ſhorte ſhould we come, to thinke that the ſame are as apparantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the frame of the worlde? Greate is the darkeneſſe of mennes mindes, and oft times, euen in thoſe thyngs that are ſuppoſed to be moſte manifeſte by Nature, they are more blynde than is the Owle in the noone dayes. And then doe we all commonlye moſte fouly ouerſhoote and deceiue our ſelues, when we beginne once to diſpute of <hi>GOD</hi> and of matters appertayning to ſaluation.

                  </gap> as hée, without anye knowledge of good letters, hadde both perfitely learned withoute Booke the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by hearing them redde (I vſe the wards of Sainct Auguſtine, in the beginning of his worke of <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine</hi>) and alſo wiſely vnderſtoode them, by ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and conſidering of them: but it were no wiſedome for others that are vtterly voyde of the knowledge of the Scriptures, ſo to ſpeake. The ſumme therefore of the matter is this, that in Nature are ſéene onely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne pictures, and (as a man would ſay) counterfettes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21011:24"/>of things, in Scripture the thing and truth it ſelfe, and therefore, that all opinions as touching Religion, whiche are to be accompted firme and ſtable, ought to be ratifyed by the warrante and defence of the holye Scriptures.</p>

And for this cauſe verily it is, why the cuſtome is commonlye receyued, that the rules of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Arte and diſcipline are of Authoures penned and written in certayne Bookes. Yea, and Sainct <hi>Hierome</hi> in hys Preface to the waylings of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> is bolde to ſaye, <hi>That the doctrine of Bookes ſhall no ſooner ceaſſe and haue an ende, than wee in a better ſtate of lyfe, ſhall bee wyth Chryſte, and become lyke vnto the Angels.</hi> Wherefore, if ſo bée wée wyll vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye weygh and conſider theſe thrée cauſes, truelie they maye worthylie moue vs to loue, and embrace the Booke of holy Scripture, before all other Bookes, and euen wyth earneſt deſyre, to be occupyed in it daye and nighte. Admitte (if you wyll) that the Booke of the nature of things is wonderfull, and in manye
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:21011:24"/>reſpectes hyghly to bée eſtéemed: yet no man is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante of thys, that among dyuers Bookes offered, that eſpeciallye is to bée preferred before the reſte, whyche wée ſée to excell both in weyghtyneſſe of the contentes, in the methode and playneneſſe of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng, and for manye cauſes, to bée moſt expediente for vs. Good Scholemayſters are accuſtomed to propounde and commende to theyr hearers ſuche Bookes as they ſuppoſe to bée moſte profitable for them: and hée that is a thriftie Scholer, deſpiſeth not the iudgemente of hys Mayſter, but prouideth them deſirouſly, exerciſeth hymſelfe in them, and maketh greate accompte of them, conſidering, that vnleſſe hée ſo doe, it wyll come to paſſe, that hée ſhall with ſhame bée thruſt out of the Schole, and ſhall haue hys name vtterlye razed oute of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the learned.</p>
               <p>Tell mée therefore, ſéeyng <hi>GOD</hi> oure Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayſter, both moſt wyſe, and alſo moſt deſirous of oure profiting, dothe commende vnto vs (more than canne bée vttered in wordes) the Booke of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and wée oure ſelues maye iudge the ſame farre to ſurmounte all other Bookes, ſhall not gréeuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhmente worthely bée alotted vnto vs, if wée ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prouide, nor endeauour to reade the holye and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bible?</p>
               <p>Wherefore; to the ende I maye ſtirre vppe (as wyth a watchworde, and an alarum gyuen) all the profeſſors of Chriſtian Religion, to the diligente reading of thys Booke, wherein are written the verye wordes of <hi>GOD,</hi> I wyll aſſay to ſette downe in order certayne reaſons, as they ſhall come to hande: hauyng this eſpeciallye in my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that ſo manye as is poſſible, whyleſt they

For I am fully perſuaded of this, and I couet to haue all men perſuaded of the lyke, that it can not be, that anye man ſhoulde often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and attentiuely reade, or heare redde the holye Scripture, but that he ſhall féele himſelfe dayly to goe forwarde, and to profyte ſomewhat in amendmente of lyfe, and in the exerciſes of goolineſſe. For why, it is not for nothing that <hi>GOD</hi> himſelfe in the Prophete Eſay Chap. <hi>55.</hi> ſayth, <hi>Like as the rayne and the Snow co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth downe from Heauen, and returneth not thither agayne, but watereth the earth, and maketh it to bring foorthe and budde, that it may giue ſeede to the ſower, and bread vnto him that eateth: euen ſo ſhall my word be that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of my mouth, it ſhall not returne vnto me voyd, but it ſhall accompliſh that which I will, and it ſhal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in the thyng whereto I ſende it.</hi> And truely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teacheth vs, that the matter is euen ſo as the Prophete ſayeth.

               <p>As therefore wée ſhewed at the beginning,<note place="margin">It behoueth all men to reade the word of <hi>GOD,</hi> in that it is graunted to them only to ſpeake and vnderstand.</note> that all the ſorte of vs ought to learne matters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, and the will of <hi>GOD,</hi> for that we are men created of <hi>GOD:</hi> ſo for bycauſe it is euidente, that all that knowledge is to bée gotten out of that Booke, wherein the wordes or Sermons of <hi>GOD</hi> are deſcribed and conteyned, it is worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie required of manne (to whome alone it is gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to vtter diſtinctlye wordes of ſignification, to

For tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the power of ſpeaking and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of wordes, man excelleth all other creatures. Whiche benefite it is requiſite that we acknowlege to be ſo much the more notable, by howe muche more wee are all moued by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to griefe, ſo ofte as we looke vpon anye that are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the ſhape of men, &amp; yet voyde of the vſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and reaſon.

               <p>In the meane time the godly Doctors and Teachers neuer ceaſſed to exhorte their godlye hearers, that they woulde daylye alſo reade ouer the holy Scriptures at home at their owne houſes, that they woulde priuatelye call to minde the things that they hadde publikely heard, and that by the example of thoſe of <hi>Berea,</hi> they would du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weigh and examine them by the ballaunce and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, of the Scriptures. And of the peoples diligence &amp; profiting at that time in reading the holy Scriptures, this is no doubtfull argument, for that it was not néed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the Doctours themſelues (thoughe ſome men in theſe oure dayes doe very weywardly and importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vrge it) to expreſſe at all times the names of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours and Chapters of the holy bookes: In as much as the people themſelues, ſo ſoone as they hadde hearde any place alleaged and broughte forth, by and by vnderſtood in what Author, in what booke, and in what parte of the booke the ſame was to be founde: as they that were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye well exerciſed by reaſon of their daylye and domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reading.

Wherefore, if thou dwelleſt in ſuche a place, where as the Propheticall and Apoſtolique writings are not accuſtomed to bée recited in holy publike aſſemblies, then forſooth is it moſt requiſite and neceſſarie, that thou ſhouldeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vnto thy ſelfe a perpetuall and vnchangeable Lawe, as touching the dayly reading of them at home at thy houſe.

It ſhall be ſufficient therefore to adde only a few of them, out of which, euery man may take as it were a taſt of the reſt. In his Homilie, <hi>9.</hi> vpon the Epiſtle to the Coloſſians, entreating of theſe words, <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you plenteouſly. Hearken</hi> (ſayeth he) <hi>yee men of the world, euen ſo many of you as are heere preſente, and haue the ouerſight of wiues and children, how it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded euen to you eſpecially to reade the Scriptures, and that alſo not ſlightely, nor ſlackly, but with greate heedefulneſſe and diligence. For like as he that is ritch in ſubſtance, may well away ſometime with loſſe and hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance, euen ſo may he alſo that is ritch in wiſedome, take well in worth not only pouertie, but all other cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities likewiſe whatſoeuer, and that ſo muche the more eaſilie.</hi> And after a fewe wordes, <hi>Neyther weigh thou</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>anye other teacher. Thou haſt the Oracles of GOD, no man can teach thee like vnto them. Some other peraduenture may ofttimes, eyther through vaineglory, or through enuie, keepe backe manye things from thee. Heare I beſeeche you, all yee worldly men, purchaſe to your ſelues the Bible, as a medicine for your ſoule: if you will not be at all that coſt, buy at the leaſt the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamente, the Actes of the Apoſtles, the Goſpels and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles to be youre continuall teachers and inſtructers. If trouble come, reſort hither as to a ſtorehouſe of remedies and medicines: from hence, take vnto you the eaſemente of your griefe, the comforte of your croſſe, whether it be hurt or hinderance, or death, or loſſe of goodes, or loſſe of friends that happen vnto you: nay, reſorte not hither, and looke in only, but turne al things ouer and ouer, and conteyne them in your mindes. This finally is the cauſe of all euils, euen the ignorance of the Scriptures. We goe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21011:41"/>to the battell without weapons, and how can we be ſafe? Armed men are wont to get the vpper hand, and to ſaue themſelues: ſo are naked men neuer. Caſte not al things vpon our ſhoulders. Yee are ſheepe: yet not withoute reaſon, but reaſonable: Paule committeth many thinges to you alſo. They that are ſente to inſtructe others, reſte not alwayes vppon this, that they might learne: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhoulde not learne well. If thou alwayes bee a learner, thou ſhalte neuer bee learned. Come not in ſuche order, as thou wouldeſt alwayes bee taughte, for ſo thou ſhalte neuer come to knowledge: but as one that woulde at length make an ende of learning, and ſo teache others in the ſame Arte or Skill.</hi> Againe, in the ſame place, to the fathers of houſholdes he ſayeth: <hi>It behoued you onely to be inſtructed by vs, and youre wiues and children to bee inſtructed by you. But you leaue all thinges to bee accompliſhed of vs: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuſteine wee no little griefe. Teache</hi> (ſayeth the Apoſtle) <hi>and admoniſhe you one another in Pſalmes, and Hymnes, and ſpirituall ſongs. Where hee giueth vs to vnderſtande alſo, that it is the duetye of parentes, to teache their children Pſalmes and Songs.</hi> The ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour expounding publikely to the people the Booke of Geneſis, Homilie <hi>29.</hi> ſayeth thus: <hi>I pray and beſeeche you, that you woulde repayre hither oftentimes, and gyue diligent heede to the reading of the holye Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: and that not onelye when yee come hither, but at home alſo at youre houſes, take the Bible into your handes, and wyth a greate care and induſtrie receiue the profite contayned therein. For why, thereby ſhall yee reape muche gaine. For firſte of all by readyng is the tongue reformed: then nexte the ſoule taketh wings, and mounteth alofte, and by the beames of the Sunne of Righteouſneſſe is illuminated and made light: and during all that time, is ridde from the enticementes
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21011:42"/>of vncleane thoughtes, and enioyeth muche quietneſſe and tranquilitie. Moreouer, loke what ſtrength ſenſible meate giueth to the bodye, the ſame giueth readyng to the ſoule. For it is a ſpirituall nouriſhment, and maketh the ſoule ſtrong, and conſtanter, and more deſirous of wiſedome: not ſuffering it to be ouertaken with foolyſh cogitations, but making it light and nimble with wings, tranſlateth it, as is ſayde, into heauen it ſelfe. So greate a gaine therefore, I beſeech you, let vs not looſe throughe our negligence: but let vs both at home apply our ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to the reading of the diuine Scriptures, and alſo being here preſent let vs not ſpende the time in trifles and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable communications: but weyghing wherfore we come togither, let vs giue good heede to the things that are read, that hauing reaped the greater fruite thereby, we maye ſo depart.</hi> And not much after he addeth: <hi>That wee oughte ſo to giue our ſelues to the ſtudies of holye Scripture, as that we maye haue things not only ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our owne vſe, but what alſo wee maye miniſter vnto others, as well,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>in reforming of our wiues, children, and ſeruants, as alſo of our neyghbours, friends, and enimies. For ſuch is the nature of ſpiritual doctrines, that they may be propounded in common to al, &amp; there is no diuerſitie in them, except it be when one bringeth a minde more attentiuely bente than another, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one ſurmounteth another with a more feruente deſire, &amp;c.</hi> Neyther can I ouerpaſſe the chiding ſpeache or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation, that the ſame holye father in his thirtéenth Homily vppon the Goſpell of Iohn ſometyme vſed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſomewhat long and tedious. <hi>Let vs bluſhe,</hi> ſayeth he, <hi>and be aſhamed: the woman that had had fiue husbandes, and was a Samaritane, vſeth ſo greate dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in learning, that ſhee coulde neyther in the time of the daye, nor by any other lettes or occaſions be withdrawn
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:21011:42"/>from the doctrine of Ieſus: Whereas wee doe not onlye not enquire after any thyng that might tende to oure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in heauenly things, but alſo are verye careleſſe in all thynges and alwayes like affected, and therefore paſſe for no manner of thyng that good is. Which of vs, I praye you, when hee commeth home, taketh in hande anye worke worthy of a Chriſtian? who ſearcheth for the meaning of the Scriptures? None truely: but as for dice and tables, we finde them commonly, bookes verye ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: which yet if any haue, they keepe, as though they hadde them not, cloſe in theyr Coffers, or elſe all theyr ſtudye conſiſtes in ſetting forth the leaues and couers, and in making the letters beautifull to the eye: not to the intent to reade them, neyther to gette any profite by them: but to vaunte of their riches, to ſhewe their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, therefore ſtudye they in them. So greate is their vaine glorie. I heare of no ambitious perſon, that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth his booke: but hee is in loue onely with the glittering gloſe of the golden letters. What gaine call yee this I beſeeche you? The Scriptures are not therefore giuen vs, that we ſhould haue them in bookes alone, but that we ſhoulde engraue them in our heartes. Therefore this outwarde poſſeſsion of bookes is a token of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouſneſſe of the Iewes, to whom the commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were giuen in letters: to vs are they not ſo giuen, but in fleſhly tables of the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Howbeit I forbidde no manne to buye bookes: but I admoniſhe, and with all my heart deſire, that we may buye them: yet ſo as we maye oft times ponder both the letters and their meanings in our mindes, and by thys meanes haue a pure minde wrought within vs. For if in what houſe ſo euer the Goſpell be, there the Diuel dare not enter; then how muche leſſe power ſhall the Diuell
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21011:43"/>or Sinne haue ouer that ſoule, that is acquainted with it by continuall readings? Sanctify therefore they ſoule, ſan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifye thy body: this ſhall come to paſſe, if thou haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the Goſpell both in thy heart and tongue. Where, if the filthineſſe of thy tong defyleth the ſoule, if it call vppon Diuels it is euident, that by ſpirituall reading the ſame is ſanctified, and the grace of the holy Ghoſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly powred into it. The Scriptures be (as it were) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine charmes: From them let vs fetch a remedy for our griefe, &amp; for the maladies of our ſoule: the vtilitie wherof if we would conſider, we ſhould with attentiuenes apply oure ſtudy in them. Theſe things I oftentimes touch: Is it not a thing very prepoſterous, that common market menne ſhoulde beare in minde, the names of Cartars and Dauncers, their kinds, countreis, actions, maners, and tell likewiſe of the proweſſe of horſes, and what euerye one coulde doe: and they that come hither, goe their wayes knowing nothing at all, no not ſo muche as the number of the holy Bookes?</hi> Thus muche hath this moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Preacher (queſtionleſſe) in that place, who in other places alſo ofte times ſingeth the ſelfe ſame ſong: as in verye déede that ſong is neuer thoughte to be oute of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whych is acceptable to the eares of all men, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye of ſuche as are ſkilfull in Muſicke, and is of it ſelfe verye ſwéete and delectable, for in his two and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith Homilie vppon Iohn, he againe wiſheth all men to haue the Bookes of holye Scripture in their houſes, and diligentlye to peruſe them throughe. In hys four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téenth Homilie, hée requireth greate diligence to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in ſearching of the Scriptures. And euerye where in the beginnings of hys Sermons: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the latter endes or perorations hée entreateth of the manifolde vſe of the Scriptures: Vppon whyche occaſion hée efteſoones vrgeth, requyreth, enforceth: and pricketh forwarde all menne, that whenſoeuer
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21011:43"/>oportunitie ſhall ſerue, they woulde as well at home as abroade, conferre togither of the doctrine of godlyneſſe: that they would as touching doubtfull places, both aſke the opinion of others, and alſo now and then ſhew their owne iudgement: that they would draw this practiſe as a cuſtome, and perpetually kéepe it in vre. But what if yée ſhoude haue hearde <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> himſelfe vttering his owne words? for let it be lawfull to me, I beſéeche you, to vſurpe the ſelfeſame words of this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that <hi>Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi> ſometimes did of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> whome he enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely for deſire of glorie. Albeit we haue this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge after a ſort graunted vnto vs, euen to heare hym alſo, whyleſt the things whiche he moſte ſwéetely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the chiefe Citie and ſeate of a moſt mightye Empire, we may reade in Authe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tical writing publiſhed throughout the whole worlde: euen in like ſorte as the edictes and proclamations of kings and princes are out of one notable place heard a farre off, and take effect in all prouinces.</p>
               <p>But leaſt any man ſhoulde ſuppoſe, that the Gréeke writers and Doctours of the Eaſt Churches, whome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therewiſe ſome affirme (let them ſée with what iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and with what right they ſpeake it) to diſagrée and erre in many things from the Latines and weſt Churches, were only and altogither of this minde: heare I beſéech you, likewiſe the voyces of the Latine writers, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſelfe ſame cauſe. What accompt makeſt thou of Hierom, what of Auguſtine? Thou graunteſt them, I am ſure, to be of the number of the chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Diuines. Then marke what Hierome hathe noted vppon thoſe wordes of the ſecond Epiſtle to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, the thirtéenth Chapter. <hi>Laſte of al my brethren, fare yee well, bee perfect, be of good comforte. It is to be noted</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that writing to the whole Churche, he telleth them they oughte to be perfite: and that the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:21011:44"/>Laitie ought one to exhort an other.</hi> Again vpon thoſe words of Paule to the Coloſſians Cap. <hi>3. Let the word of Chriſt dwel in you. Here it is ſhewed, that the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ought to haue not onely ſufficiently, but abundaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo, the worde of Chriſte dwelling in them, and that they ought to teache or admoniſhe one an other.</hi> But what? me thinketh thou biteſt in thy lippe, and couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mockeſt me, crying out againſt me, that there is not ſo muche as one crumme of Hieroms meaning in thoſe Commentaries. Go to, verily (if thou wilte) be it ſo. But what if we ſette downe other things, whiche thou neuer dareſt to reiect as ſtraunge or counterfaite, and yet haue the ſelfe ſame meaning, that the wordes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng before haue? Heare what hée ſayth, expounding the ſeconde Chapiter of the Epiſtle to Titus: <hi>Lette the ſenſes bee exerciſed, and the minde dailye fedde with diuine readings, and ſo ſhall our queſtions not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fooliſhe.</hi> There is no man in a manner but kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the learned and long Epiſtle of Hierome writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Paulinus.</hi> In this is contayned a huge heape of moſte excellent reaſons, prouoking to the ſtudy of the holy Scriptures: where are ſo digeſted and putte in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the whole Epiſtle ſéeth not to bée written to <hi>Paulinus</hi> alone, but generallye alſo to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. In conſideration wherof, it came to paſſe alſo, that our aunceſtours nowe for certaine ages paſte whoulde haue the ſame as a moſt profitable inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like as it is in very déed, to be prefixed &amp; ſet before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Bible.

Tranſferre the loue of collers &amp; iewels and ſilken garments, to the knowlege of the holy Scriptures.</hi> Againe: <hi>Thou haſt Exuperius of an approued age and Fayth, which may oftimes enſtruct thee with his godly admonitions.</hi> He comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer <hi>Furiaes</hi> ſiſter, for hir exquiſite knowlege in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures: <hi>O that thou ſaweſt,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>thy ſiſter, &amp; mighteſt but heare face to face the ſweete eloquence of hir ſacred mouth, thou ſhouldeſt ſee in a litle body what wonderfull courage of minde there were.

He wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to <hi>Laeta,</hi> to <hi>Demetriades,</hi> to <hi>Saluina,</hi> to <hi>Furia,</hi> to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtia</hi> the widowe, to <hi>Celantia,</hi> to <hi>Mercella,</hi> to <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> the virgin, to <hi>Euſtochium,</hi> to <hi>Paula,</hi> to <hi>Theodora,</hi> to <hi>Briſilla,</hi> to <hi>Caſtorina,</hi> to <hi>Nitia,</hi> to <hi>Aſella,</hi> to <hi>Sunia,</hi> to <hi>Fretela,</hi> to <hi>Hedibidia,</hi> to <hi>Algaſia,</hi> to <hi>Vrbica.</hi> What maye be ſayde of thys moreouer, that he dedicateth certaine of his workes, wherein he expoundeth many of the bookes of holy Scripture, to <hi>Paula,</hi> to <hi>Euſtochium,</hi> and <hi>Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and rendereth a reaſon of this his doing in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to <hi>Sophony</hi> the Prophete? And in all theſe to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he writeth, he alwayes for the moſte parte either pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, or accounteth prayſe worthy, partly their loue and ſtudy of the holy Scriptures, partlye their knowledge and vnderſtandyng: or (whyche is leaſte of all) to the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21011:46"/>intent they myghte endeauour to bring to paſſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng worthye of commendation in perceyuing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of religion, hée both beſéecheth them by commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, and commaundeth them by beſéeching. In many other places beſides, when occaſion ſerueth, he handleth the ſelfſame cauſe. In the proeme of his thirde booke of Commentaries vpon the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, and euen incontinentlye in the enarration it ſelfe, againe in the tenth Chapter of Eccleſiaſtes, he ſaith: <hi>that al ought to get wiſedome by dayly reading of the Scriptures, and to meditate without ceaſsing in the Lawe of the Lorde.</hi> In his expoſition of the firſte Chapter of the Epiſtle to Titus, he blameth them, whyche doe contemne thoſe that are ſtudious of holye learning as vnprofitable and vaine. But that is very worthy the noting, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be vnderſtanded of our times, whyche in the end of his Commentarie vpon <hi>Nahum</hi> the Prophete, he ſayth, woulde come to paſſe, namely <hi>that aboute the comming of Chriſt to execute iudgement, the people euery where ſhoulde flocke togither to learne the holye Scriptures.</hi> Now then that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comming of Chriſt, is euen at hand, it is forſooth more certaine and ſure than that it is lawfull for any man to doubt.</p>
               <p>Furthermore fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ierome diſagréeth not Au.<note place="margin">Augustine.</note> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who for the defence of ſound doctrine againſt the treacheries of Heretickes, no man hath ſuſtayned more paineful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. He therefore writing to <hi>voluſianus</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>3,</hi> auoucheth, <hi>that the Scriptures are to be redde not only of the learned, but alſo of the vnlearned, and euen of all ſortes of men whatſoeuer. For why, it was proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by GOD, that the holy Oracles ſhould be written in a ſimple and playne kynde of ſpeache: leaſte anye manne ſhould pretende, that hee vnderſtoode nothing in them. The very phraſe of ſpeaking,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>wherein the holy Scripture is indited, albeit it be eaſie vnto al, yet
<pb n="06" facs="tcp:21011:47"/>are very fewe able to pierce into it: the thinges that are apparant, are as a familiar friend ſpeaking without guile to the hearte, as well of the learned as vnlearned. But thoſe thinges whiche the holy Ghoſt wrappeth in miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, neyther doeth hee lyfte vp with proude eloquence, anye otherwiſe than euen the drooping and vnlearned ſoule may be bold to approch, as a poore man to a ritche: but he inuiteth al men with his lowly maner of ſpeeche: whome hee doth not onelye feede with manifeſt truth, but alſo exerciſe in ſecrete veritie: being of like nature in things eaſie, as he is in things hidden. But leaſt the things that are open &amp; plaine ſhould breed contempt, the ſame again are hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end they ſhould be longed after, &amp; being longed after, ſhould after a ſort be renued, &amp; being renued, ſhould ſweetely be embraced. Hereby are bothe crabbed wits holſomly corrected, &amp; ſmall wits noriſhed, &amp; great wits delighted. That mind is an enimy to this do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctrine, that either throgh error knoweth it not to be moſt holſome, or in being ſicke, hateth to bee healed.</hi> Thus much in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place. It is thoght alſo, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſome of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fathers did of a ſet purpoſe put forth certaine of their workes in a homely kind of ſtile, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> intent euery one euen among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common ſorte, and vnlearned artificers (vnto whome notwithſtanding the Latine tongue was at that time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye where familiar, howbeit ſomewhat corrupted) might the more willingly peruſe them ouer, and all both learned and vnlearned enioye in common togither the commodities of godly doctrine. As touching whych mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>D. Eraſmus Roterodamus,</hi> as moſte ſharpe and ſeuere Iudge (if euer there were anye) of an other mans ſtile, in writing, hathe diſcourſed at large in an Epiſtle whyche hée prefixed before the Commentaries of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius</hi> vppon all the Pſalmes. The ſame man, where hée ſheweth his iudgement as touching ſundrye bookes of Saint Auguſtines, admoniſheth, that there is a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21011:47"/>booke extant <hi>of the maners of the Catholike Church,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled and written by Saint Auguſtine, in a wonderfull elegant ſtile: but in that whiche followeth as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>the maners of the Mainchees,</hi> that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of ſpéech is debaced to the capacitie and vnderſtanding of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gare people. Thou wouldeſt ſuppoſe, that it were not the ſame Authors: but Charitie, whereby they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelues with the Apoſtle <hi>to be debtors both to the learned and vnlearned,</hi> Rom. <hi>1.</hi> &amp; couet indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to prouide for all men alike, enforceth them to vſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and ſundrye kindes of ſpeaking. But that we may retourne to the iudgement of Saint Auguſtine as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reading of the holye Scriptures, he in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde booke, and. <hi>38.</hi> Chapter of his <hi>Retractations,</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyeth, that Laie men ſtudious of the diuine Oracles had ſent vnto him certaine writings, concerning the doctrine of Religion, and that the againe, as was méete and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient had made aunſwere vnto them: Vppon whiche occaſion hée affirmeth, that his worke <hi>De fide &amp; operibus</hi> tooke the beginning. And that in thoſe dayes the Laitie was accuſtomed of their owne accorde to handle the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, that they had ſcarce anye néede of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, this may be a proofe ſuffcient, that Auguſtine, like as Hierome alſo before hym, was often tymes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Seing then that by theſe and ſuch like reaſons S. Auguſtine witneſſeth abundantlye that the ſtudye of holy Scripture was in his tyme verye common and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar among men: and that the people of al ſorts, ſexes, and ages were able then godlye and expreſſely bothe to queſtion and make aunſwere as touching the affayres of religion: it ſhould be ſuperfluous, to enterlace in theſe our wrytings, the exhortations to the ſame ſtudy, why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che are to be founde in his workes verye frequent and forceable. Verily out of one onely Sermon, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled <hi>Of the ſtudy of Wiſdome &amp; meditation of Gods lawe,</hi> as out of one bed I will gather certaine floures, whereby euery manne maye eaſily coniecture what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of poſies of the ſame ſorte are to be founde in the reſt of hys Sermons. <hi>We haue yet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a good comfort in reding the holy Scripturs: bicauſe the reding of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripturs is no ſmall foreknowlege of the diuine bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe. For in them, as in a certaine glaſſe, a man maye conſider of himſelfe, what hee is, or whether he goeth. Continuall reading purifyeth all things, it cauſeth feare of hel ſire, it ſtirreth vp the heart of the reader to long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heauenly ioyes. Hee that will alwayes be with GOD, ought often to pray and reade. For when we praye, wee talke with GOD: and when we read, GOD talketh with vs. The reading of the holy Scriptures bringeth with it a double commoditie, either for that it inſtructeth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the ſoule, or bycauſe it leadeth a man fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vanities of the world to the loue of GOD: the labour beſtowed in reading is commendable, &amp; auayleth much to the clenſing of the minde. For like as the fleſh is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed with carnal meates: ſo is the inner man nouriſhed and fed with the diuine Oracles of GOD:</hi> as ſayeth the Pſalmeſt: <hi>How ſweet are thy teſtimonies to my mouth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21011:48"/>oh Lord? yea they are ſweeter than hony and the honye combe. But he is moſte bleſſed of all, that ſo readeth the holy ſcriptures, as he turneth them into practiſe.</hi> Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hée.

For, that a gentle and diſcréete Diſciple ſhoulde vary and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agrée from his faithfull Schoolemayſter, profeſſing the truth, is a thing verye rare, or at leaſte verye vncomely and vnciuill. And vndoubtedly their Epiſtles written to Laye menne of diuers nations, likewiſe vnto Virgins, matrones, widowes, in al prouinces where they dwelte, doe declare, that there were a great number, that appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelues luſtily to the reading fo the holye Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

How ſwéete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly didde ſuch reaſon and conferre togither of the doctrine of the Lawe and the Goſpell, and of all the dueties of godlineſſe? Certes I beléeue, the godly in thoſe dayes tried among themſelues moſte honeſte mayſteries, as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21011:49"/>family to be founde, in which there was not eyther the maiſter or miſtreſſe, eyther the ſonne or the daughter, or at leaſte wiſe ſome one or other of the houſeholde, that coulde not at appointed times reade certaine Chapters of the holy Bible, and indifferently wel expounde all the profitableſt places in them.</p>
               <p>The holy bookes were at that time counted for moſte precious houſeholde ſtuffe: and euery houſe was after a ſorte (I ſay) not only a ſchole, but euen a Churche alſo, adorned and beautifyed with the dayly exerciſes of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scriptures, interpretations and prayers. Of whyche houſes it is certaine that the Apoſtlement, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Romaynes the ſixtéenth he ſaluted the Churche which was in the houſe of <hi>Priſca</hi> and <hi>Aquila,</hi> and when as writing to <hi>Philemon,</hi> he wiſheth well to the whole Churche that remayned in his houſe. But what thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou woulde thoſe holye fathers ſaye, if it were ſo that they might now liue again? They gently &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admoniſhe, they ſeuerely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, one while pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to all, another while priuately to euery one, that they ſhoulde themſelues with all care and enforcemente faſhion and conforme their mindes by the reading of the holy Scriptures: and this did they at that time, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Common weales</hi> were on euery ſide afflicted with warres and tumultes, wherein the Churches were with the ſtormes of Hereſies and Schiſmes vtterly in a manner ouerwhelmed and torne in ſunder, wherin was a horrible and lamentable confuſion almoſte of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine affaires, wherein men were conſtrained to paye verye deare for their bookes written in parchments: and yet notwithſtanding they had innumerable hearers of euery ſort, age, and ſexe, which gently toke in good parte their godly admonitions, and moſt willingly obeyed the ſame. But now, when as al things are indifferently qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et both at home and abroade, and we inioye, if no conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall

Nay rather (whyche is farre more bitter,<note place="margin">Now a dayes ſome Biſhops there be that forbid the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures to be read.</note> and ſhamefull to be ſpoken, as that whyche tendeth to the vnſpeakeable reproche of Gods glorie and of the true and Catholike Churche) there are founde in ſome places Prelates of Churches, whiche with grieuous threatnings and penalties doe vtterly forbidde the people to reade them or once to meddle with them. Yea and we haue tryed by experience, that ſome good men haue bene ſore puniſhed of ſuche, for that they had begunne to reade (how little ſoeuer it were) at home in their houſes. And (whych thou mayſte more maruell at) when the wicked rage of ſome curſed perſons coulde not with thys crueltie be ſatiſfied, they tooke delighte moreouer to bring to paſſe, that the like outrage ſhoulde be ſhewed euen to the harmleſſe bookes themſelues. For euen in our time the holy Bibles haue in ſome places o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and by publike officers bene curſed to the fire, and conſumed to aſhes.

How long O Lord ſhal theſe abuſe thy patience? Seeſt thou ſo many and ſo greate iniuries to be done vnto thy name, and yet deferreft thou to take vengeaunce? To thée oh <hi>GOD,</hi> to thee that art Lord of al reuengements, we leaue vengeaunce: thou, when thou ſéeſt thy time, wilt repaie.

Verily, I
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21011:63"/>remember that I hearde ouce in <hi>Fraunce</hi> one beyng old and hoareheaded, and a man of ſingular modeſtie, tel and reporte, that he was declared Doctor of Diuinitie in the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Schoole at <hi>Paru,</hi> when as hée had neuer in all his life read ouer ſo muche as thrée Chapiters of the holy Bible: and further, that he was afterwarde the Paſtor of no obſcure Churche: and althoughe he dayly deſcanted vppon the hundreth and ninetéenth Pſalme, wherein is wonderfully commended the ſtudy, efficacie and vſe of Gods worde: and here and there alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated theſe wordes, <hi>In the lawe of the Lorde wil I me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate day and night,</hi> yet notwithſtanding that it neuer came into his minde one whit to peruſe the Bookes of holy Scripture with a deſire of vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the truth, nor neuer made alſo any Sermon oute of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the people. Whyche thinges he not wythout an honeſt kinde of ſhame, callyng to remembraunce, bothe bewayled the vnhappineſſe of the tyme paſt, and alſo complayned of the ſhamefull ignorance of the men of his coate and calling. Yea, and moreouer in dyuers Countries where I haue trauailed, I haue ſéene many Prieſtes (as my manner is in euery place to enquyre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently of the ſtate of Churches) whyche when they were vtterly voyde of learning, and very Drones had no Churche, wherein they mighte lawfully miniſter: But out of their Maſſes (as they call them) whych they beyng hyred, daylye ſayde, they ſucked out no ſmall gaine and aduantage, &amp; ſuſtained themſelues in their filthy ydleneſſe. Furthermore we ſée it euerye where commonly receiued, not by cuſtome, but as yée woulde ſaye by a lawe eſtabliſhed, that Prieſtes are made wythoute choyce, no more, as they were in times paſt, to teache, but onelye to ſay Maſſe. As who ſhould ſay forſooth this way do the holy Byſhops followe the holy Cannons, whyche forbidde that without a title (for ſo
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:21011:63"/>they ſpeake) any man ſhoulde be ordered: Diſtinction <hi>70.</hi> C. <hi>Neminem &amp; Sanctorum Canonum, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore as touching the Doctrine of Religion, there is among them no further queſtion: but it maye be ſayde as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome ſpeaketh, expounding the thirtéenth Chapiter of Ezechiel, that <hi>for the ſinnes of men the word of GOD is vtterly loſte, and that grieuous calamitie ſent downe into the worlde, that GOD by the Prophet Amos Cap. 8 threatneth, namely, a cruell hunger, thirſte, and ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of hearing the worde of GOD.</hi> The other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences whyche haue flowed oute of that fountayne, to witte, the falſe perſwaſion of the Miniſtery to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte in bare Songs and Ceremonies, I ceaſſe to make any further reckening of.</p>
               <p>But to procéede, where Biſhops do not prouide that the Scriptures be continually readde and expounded in Churches, and yet giue orders to a greate number of ſuche, as they knowe haue neyther beſtowed any time before in ſtudying the holy Scriptures, neyther can or will do hereafter: I leaue it to be conſidered of euerye man, whether ſuche either Byſhops, or Prieſtes, can rightly chalenge to themſelues the power Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and kayes of the kingdome of Heauen, as granted vnto them of God or no. We haue learned forſooth out of the Sermons of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, that there is a double power of the Churches, or that there be two kayes: the one of Doctrine, whyche conſiſteth in tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng, that is to ſaye in interpreting the Scriptures, and adminiſtration of the Sacramentes whiche are annexed to the worde, and euen a certaine portion of the worde, like as in very déede they are acompliſhed by the worde: the other is prepared to giue iudgement, and to binde and looſe.

Certeſſe that no keyes of Chriſtes Church are committed to vnlearned Prieſtes, it is well proued by the iudgement of thoſe Prelates, that ouer and beſides that they haue deputed a good parte of the rabblement of Prieſtes only, as I ſayde, to the execution of Maſſerites, and Ceremonies, haue moreouer deuiſed certaine caſes, which they name Reſerued, whereof ſome they wil haue referred to the Biſhops only of euery Church, otherſome only and alone to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now there ſhoulde be no néede to trudge for counſell to the higher Prelates, if ſo be they déemed the Prieſts, which themſelues had made, fitte to giue iudgement of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters incident, and ſufficiently furniſhed to bind and loſe. But that which the authours of reſerued caſes haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly proteſted touching certayne Prieſtes, the ſame may we interprete worthily to be vnderſtoode of all in generall, whether they be Biſhops or Prieſtes, that are founde voyde and deſtitute of all furniture of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Héereby then we ſhall be inforced to ſuſpect, that many Churches haue of long time wanted, and bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither withoute keyes. For the vnderſtanding and interpretation of the Scriptures, being once loſte, it coulde not be choſen, but that the keyes muſt néedes haue bin loſt alſo. And in what ſtate the houſe is, that is neyther opened nor ſhutte at any tyme with keyes, but hauing as yée woulde ſaye, the lockes and dores broken all to fitters, ſtandeth on euery ſide, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, and to euery one that commeth wide open: in the very ſame ſtate we ſuppoſe the Churches to haue

But we ſhall haue leſſe cauſe to maruayle that Prieſtes haue not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto bin carefull of receyuing the true keyes, if in caſe we conſider that a number of them haue not bene accuſtomed to go in and out by the dore, but by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, and that there haue appeared in them more liuely markes of hirelings, than of anye true Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardes.

This age doth of all other ſtand moſt chiefely in neede of Spirituall admonitions: it is greene and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and quickly drincketh in the liquors that are drip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into it. If any man wil go about to draw them euen from their cradles, and (as yee would ſay) from the very traces of ſinne, vnto the way of vertue, he ſhal confirme them in a certayne ſtayedneſſe and nature of godly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Neyther will they lightly of their owne accorde, fall into a worſer biaſſe, where they haue with ſuche a cuſtome as this, bin allured from their tender yeares vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vertue. By this meanes alſo they ſhall the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly both honour and reuerence their elders. Agayne, they ſhall be made more fitte to deale in any worldly affayres.</hi> Thus much hath he there. I am compelled to adde heerevnto out of the ſame Authoure, that is to ſay, the golden wordes of his golden mouth, written in his <hi>21.</hi> Homilie vppon the Epiſtle to the Epheſians. <hi>Wouldeſt thou haue</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>thy ſonne to be well nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured? bring him vp fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his youth in the feare and nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Lord. Thinke it not to be ſuperfluous, if hee heare the holy Scriptures: for there ſhall be firſt heare this: Honour thy Father, and thy Mother. Therefore
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21011:81"/>this is done for thy behoofe. Say not, it belongeth to Monkes to heare the Scriptures. Shal I make my ſonne a Monke? No, it is not needefull for him to be a Monke. Why feareſt thou that whiche is greatly for his profite? Make him a Chriſtian. It is chiefely requiſite for world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly folkes, to knowe what things are taught them out of the Scriptures, eſpecially for children: for there is muche folly in that age. And that folly of children is muche en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, euen in outward things, when they once know that thoſe noble men alſo whome they haue in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are ſubiect to infirmities, and afrayd of deathe. Of which ſort was this, that Achilles, when he ſaw that hee muſt now dye for his concubine, repented him then of his deede: of which ſort is this alſo, namely, when one is drunke, and manye other ſuche things are committed. Theſe medicines therefore are needefull. For is it not to be thought a poynt of greate folly in thee, to ſende thy children to learning, and to prouide them Scholemay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and to ſee that nothing bee wanting for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and in the meane time not to bring them vp in the nourture and chaſtiſement of the Lorde? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do euen we firſt of all reape the fruite of this thing, that is to ſay, through our owne defaulte, we haue hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braynd, vngracious, diſobediente, and vnmanerly chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Let vs not then thus do, but let vs obey this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtle, who giueth vs good councell: let vs bring them vp in the inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and information of the Lord. Let vs ſet before them an example, cauſing them from their tender youth diligently to apply the reading of the Scriptures. Wo is me, whileſt I am thus continuallye ſpeaking, I ſeeme to do nothing elſe but trifle: howbeit, I will not ceaſſe for all that, to do that which mine office bindeth me to do.</hi> Theſe things hath he. All that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of his is very worthye to be read, as in whiche hée ſheweth with manye reaſons, that thoſe (when all is
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21011:82"/>ſaid) do beſt prouide for their children, and lay open vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the way to riches, peace, and tranquilitie of life, happie eſtate, and to preferment in Princes courts, whiche haue a care ouer them that they be inſtructed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from their infancie in the holy Scriptures. To bée ſhort, the huſbande and the wife, the parentes and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the maiſters and ſeruantes, the miſtreſſes and maydes, may find in the holy Bookes infinite as well preceptes, as examples, whiche it is not néedefull to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe, as touching all thoſe things that it behoueth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of them to doe in their ſeuerall ſtate and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. The ſame muſt thou thinke to be ſpoken both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to widowes and virgins, of whoſe care and diligence, like as alſo of the inſtruction of children in the holye Scriptures, we haue aboue ſomewhat diſcourſed. So far-forth therefore is that true, which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, <hi>De verbis Domini Sermone. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </hi> namely, <hi>that vnto all eſtates of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is preſcribed in the ſacred bookes a rule to liue by, and that all and euery ſexe, age, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, is prouoked to leade an vprighte and godly life.</hi> Therefore (as we began to ſaye before) not onely thoſe that are appoynted to the Eccleſiaſticall miniſterie, but alſo generally all Chriſtians, of what eſtate or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoeuer they be, ought dayly to beſtow ſometime (at the leaſt) in reading and pervſing the Bookes of the Prophets and Apoſtles. The continuall meditation of the Scriptures, is not the priuate and peculiar office of ſome fewe perſons, but the common and publike dutie of all Chriſtians. I graunt in déede that the godly and learned Paſtors of Churches ſhoulde goe before, but yet muſte all other ſtates and degrées followe after. There is none, neyther one nor other, that can bée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from this daunce. There is no man in this life in all reſpectes ſo perfite, vnto whome remayneth not ſome thing more to be learned: no man ſo exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſheth
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21011:82"/>his dutie, but that ſome good man (for I ſpeake not of anye ſlaunderous and enuious cauiller) may ſay vnto him: <hi>this would be amended.</hi> Wherefore I beléeue there is not any man liuing, whiche by the rules and exhortations of the holy Scriptures, may not onely become better learned, but alſo better qualified, and which by reading of the word of God, may not bée made more ſtrong and couragious to all good actions of life whatſoeuer. A greate offence it were doubtleſſe, to ſurmiſe, that the Philoſophers, or anye other perſons beſides ſhoulde be able, better to preſcribe what euerie one ought to do, or to leaue vndone, than God himſelfe. Certes the Philoſophers, Lawmakers, and other worldly wiſe men, when they diſpute of duties, doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes erre. Euidente proofes héereof we haue in <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Panaetius, Cicero,</hi> and ſuch like, whyche doe commonly one carp and controll another. Neyther doe they commend any thing as comely and honeſt, but ſo far-forth as it is déemed to be ſuche by the opinion of men. But the Prophetes and Apoſtles coulde not erre, bicauſe they were taught by the holy Ghoſt (who is the ſpirit of truth, and voyd of all error:) yea &amp; they ſo vrged &amp; commanded all things, as they knew y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of God. But to frame y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life and maners in ſuche wiſe as God maye be pleaſed with them, is no doubte a moſt ſoueraigne thing, &amp; highly to be deſired of all men. And in déede y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Philoſophers ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after a ſort tell vs what one man oweth vnto another, but what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oweth vnto god, how God ſhuld rightly be worſhipped, of true faith in God, &amp; remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſins, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inward ſpirituall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart, &amp; of other things like vnto theſe, they do not ſo much as make any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion at al, much leſſe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they perfitly declare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As oft as in the writings of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Philoſophers, ther happen any place as touching God, or as touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duty of man towards God, we ſée how
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:21011:83"/>coldly, ſlenderlye, and obſcurelye, they runne ouer it. Which truely that it ſhoulde ſo come to paſſe, God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly had ordeyned, &amp; that eyther for bycauſe they were conuicted in their owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences, and ſtayed not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any ſure foundation in theſe their diſputations: or elſe for that it was not their proper charge, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for others, the Prophets, I meane, &amp; Apoſtles, &amp; their Diſciples: and finally, for ſo much as God would haue all men to be admoniſhed by this meanes, that the perfite knowledge of God, and of his will, is to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, not out of the Bookes of the Philoſophers, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and alone out of the holy Scriptures. And this is that in effect whiche the Apoſtle meaneth <hi>2.</hi> Timoth. <hi>3.</hi> when he ſaith: <hi>That the holy Scripture inſpired of God, is profitable to inſtruct in righteouſneſſe, that the man of God may be perfect, and prepared to all good works.</hi> Wherevnto, Sainct <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hauing reſpecte in hys <hi>2.</hi> Sermon vpon the <hi>90.</hi> Pſalme, very wittily ſaid, <hi>That the holy Scriptures are letters patents, ſent downe from the heauenly Citie to vs, which do exhort vs all to lyue well.</hi> Wherfore, whoſoeuer coueting to reade the holy Bible (wherein is moſt abſolutely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed all the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> duties of all and euery Chriſtian, as wel towards God, as towards men) and to reforme his maners accordingly, requireth the ſame Bible to bée reached vnto him, he ſhal more truely a great deale ſay of it,<note place="margin">There be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne duties common to all Christians, whiche it is needefull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to learne out of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures.</note>

               <p>But I will procéede ſomewhat further to ſpeake of certayne dueties which are common to all Chriſtians, and yet in the meane time can not rightly be performed of any man, without the reading and knowledge of the Scriptures.

Onelye take héede thou diſpayre not: and accounte thy ſtate to be happye, if thou mayſte haue place in the Churche, but euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the baſeſt and weakeſt members, ſo they be ſounde, and not as yet for their rottenneſſe to be cutte quite awaye.

               <p>Howe then ſhall the Churche iudge thée to be a liuelye member of hirs, incaſe thou doeſt not homage, as thou arte bounde, vnto <hi>CHRISTE</hi> hir heade?
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21011:84"/>incaſe thou neuer bethinke thy ſelfe to vnderſtande the Doctrine of <hi>CHRISTE?</hi> incaſe ſhe perceyueth no lyfe of Fayth, no motion of anye good actions to be in thée? the Churche finally is not holpen by any duety or diligence of thine. For why, it is certayne that all the godlye do receiue lyfe and mouing, from <hi>CHRISTE</hi> their heade, and from hys worde. <hi>CHRISTE</hi> is the life of the Churche, who powreth abroade after a wonderfull manner his vitall powers into all hys members: and the wordes whyche <hi>CHRIST</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, are ſpirite and lyfe: Ioh. <hi>6.</hi> and againe, by the worde of <hi>GOD</hi> the faithfull do liue: Deut. <hi>4.</hi> Math. <hi>4.</hi> Is any of you ſo fonde and fooliſhe, as to thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for thys cauſe onelye to become a member of the Churche, for that he doeth nowe and then, or (if hée will) euerye daye in the wéeke, repayre corporally to holye aſſemblies? Nay it behoueth thée to be ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed and linked into that bodye in ſpirite, like as in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye déede the ſelfe ſame bodye is ſpirituall. But the ſpirite is nouriſhed and ſuſtained by the word, wyth the which it hath a certaine Anologie, or proportion. Now therefore if ſo be either when thou arte preſent in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall aſſemblies, whiche are eſpeciallye orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the handling of Gods worde, or when thou art returned home to thy houſe, thou intentiuely readeſt the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> heareſt it, and layeſt it vppe in thy mind: then, beléeue me, ſhalt thou bée reputed and taken in very déede for a liuely member of the Church. And truely this is a verye ſmall matter, and eaſie to be done, whyche (as a teſtimonye of thy engraffing into the Churche) wée requyre at thy handes. For if thou refuſe once to enſearche the Scriptures, doubtleſſe I doe not ſée howe thou ſhalte bée able to perfourme anye thyng worthye of commendation. Hée
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21011:85"/>that cannot abide, to apply himſelfe to the hearing and reading of Gods worde, wythout the which there is no acceſſe vnto Faith: howe ſhall we ſuppoſe, that he can be broughte to accompliſhe anye workes or dueties of Loue flowing out of Faith? for ſoothly where the word of <hi>GOD</hi> is, there is hearing: where Hearing is, there is Faith: where Fayth is, there followe of neceſſitie the workes of Loue. Be carefull therefore, to heare, reade, and vnderſtande the worde of <hi>GOD:</hi> ſo ſhalte thou haue Faith and the fruites of Faith and Workes: yea, and ſo ſhall all thinges redounde to the common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying and encreaſe of the wholebodye of the Churche Epheſ. <hi>4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I haue further to demaunde of thée O Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an (for I doe as willingly for mine owne parte attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this glorious title vnto thée,<note place="margin">Euerye Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ought to bee readye to render a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of hys Fayth to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye one that asketh it.</note> as thou for thy parte arte willing to heare it:) Wherefore, I praye thée, art thou called a Chriſtian, but bycauſe thou beléueſt in <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> and haſte once receyued baptiſme, as a ſeale of this thy fayth, and of the Righteouſneſſe thereof. But howe wilte thou perſwade vs that thou beléeueſt in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> if ſo be thou be ignorante of the articles of Fayth? if thou canſt not make confeſſion of thy Fayth? and ſo ofte as néede is render an accompte of the ſame? for there are certayne generall preceptes preſcribed indifferently to all Chriſtians, as: <hi>Hee that beleeueth, ſhall be ſaued.</hi> Math. <hi>28.</hi> Rom. <hi>10.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that confeſſeth me before men, I wil confeſſe him before my father whiche is in Heauen:</hi> Math. <hi>10.</hi> Marc. <hi>8.</hi> and Luke laſte. Againe, Rom. <hi>10. With the hearte man beleeueth vnto Righteouſneſſe, and with the mouth confeſsion is made vnto Saluation.</hi> Moreouer, the Apoſtle Peter in hys ſeconde Epiſtle and thirde Chapiter ſayth: that all thoſe that haue giuen their names vnto Chriſte, or are called Chriſtians, oughte ſo farreforthe to procéede in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21011:85"/>the ſtudy of the holy myſteries that they hauing hearde y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of their Faith out of the Prophets and Apoſtles declared in the Scriptures, mighte fully and ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye comprehended the ſame, and alſo be able euerye man for himſelfe at all times, and to euery one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth it, to render a reaſon of his faith and hope. But that any man ſhoulde be able to confeſſe his faith, and to yéelde an accompte thereof, that hathe not béene ſome ſpace conuerſante in the ſacred Scriptures, it is by no meanes probable or likely. For it is one thing ſimply to make a confeſſion of Faith, and an other to render an accompte of Faith. As for the one, it maye readilye ynoughe after a ſorte be performed of euerye manne, eſpeciallye when there is no perill of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on néere at hande: and there is no manne in a maner, which hath not ſéene at one time or other, many folkes ſo to haue learned and repeated by hearte the Symbole of the Apoſtles, yea, and the Nicene Créede, and that now &amp; then alſo in an vnknowen language, as Popin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iayes are wont to chatter whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they bid men good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe or good euen: but as touching the other, he that will do it, muſt of neceſſitie declare, that his faith is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden by the worde of <hi>GOD</hi> it ſelfe, and (as Paule ſpeaketh Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>) confirmed with the teſtimony of the lawe and the Prophets. For thou arte vtterlye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, incaſe thou thinkeſt it lawfull for thée to put ouer the office of beléeuing to another, and to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, in caſe thou confeſſeſt thy ſelfe to beléeue, as thy Godfather beléeued, which vndertooke and gaue his worde for thée at the holye Fonte, or as the Churches beléeue, or as the Miniſters of Churches. For vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly in the matter whyche appertayneth to the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſaluation of the ſoule, euerye manne oughte to be his owne factour, to be neareſt vnto hymſelfe, to gage hys owne proper Fayth béefore <hi>GOD,</hi> and the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21011:86"/>Churche, wyth hys owne proper hearte to beléeue vnto Righteouſneſſe, and with his owne proper mouth to confeſſe vnto Saluation. For like as it profiteth not thy bodye, in caſe an other manne taketh meate for thée or in thy ſteade, and thruſteth it into his owne mawe, and in the meane tyme, leaueth thée hungry and almoſte hungerſterued for wante of foode: euen ſo arte thou wonderfullye deceyued, when thou wéeneſt that it will be behouefull for thy ſoule, in caſe thou thy ſelfe beyng ignoraunte of the thynges that belong vnto Faith (whileſt I meane thou arte bothe of age and vnderſtanding méete to haue learned the worde of <hi>GOD</hi>) and making no confeſſion at all, an other man doe declare hys Faith before <hi>GOD</hi> and his Churche. This is not the waye, no, this is not the way, beléeue me, to attaine vnto the ſcope and marke of Saluation. Thoſe ſaide preceptes of beléeuing, of confeſſing, of rendring an accompte, doe in verye déede binde euerye particular man withoute anye difference. <hi>Be yee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye</hi> (ſayth Peter) <hi>to gyue a reaſon alwayes, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye one that asketh.</hi> But how canſte thou hope that thou ſhalte haue at all tymes, and in euerye place, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thy Godfathers and Godmothers, or teachers of the Churche to be preſent wyth thée, whyche wyll doe ſo muche (I meane make anſwere) for thée? And for this verye cauſe is the cuſtome commonlye receiued in the Churche, that the confeſſion of Fayth ſhoulde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Sondayes and Holy dayes, be recited in ſuche a forme, as albeit there be but one common Faith of all, like as there is but one <hi>GOD,</hi> and one Baptiſme, yet it ſhoulde not be ſaide in common, we beléeue in one <hi>GOD:</hi> but, I beléeue in one <hi>GOD,</hi> to the intent ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily euery man might perceiue, that he hath for himſelf both to make confeſſion, and alſo to render a reaſon of his faith. For whiche cauſe alſo, when Baptiſme is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:21011:86"/>miniſtred, it is vſed in all Churches and Prouinces after one and the ſelfeſame manner: as for example, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one being aſked the queſtion of the miniſter of the Church ſeuerally, aunſwereth for himſelfe, and ſayth: <hi>I beleeue in GOD the father, I beleeue in Ieſus Chriſt hys onelye begotten ſonne, I beleeue in the holye Ghoſte,</hi> and ſo foorthe: as touchyng whyche order of queſtioning and aunſweryng, there is plaine mention Act. <hi>8.</hi> where is touched the regeneration of the Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Eunuch. Neither can it be declared, howe great a peſtilence that fond opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Faith inuolued (as they terme it) ſcattered abroad by certaine vnlearned ideots, hath broughte into the minds of menne, where by they thinke they do inough, when they profeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to beléeue, as other men beléeue. For doubtleſſe here vpon hath riſen a moſte perillous ſecuritie. Yea it hath come to paſſe by little and little, that thoſe which ſhould haue obtayned ſaluation by faith, haue bin ſo bold as vtterly to neglecte and contemne Faith. But thoſe that haue once neglected &amp; caſt from them the care of their faith, howe is it poſſible that they ſhould afterward performe the workes of Charitie, eſpecially ſuch as are pleaſing and acceptable vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> of which ſort are thoſe onely and alone that flowe and procéede from Faith? And in whom there is neither Faith nor Charitie, the ſame muſt alſo of neceſſitie be deſtitute of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefite of hope. Theſe things being thus determined, it followeth, that ſuche perſons are hitherto fallen away from the grace of <hi>GOD,</hi> and oughte not to be made anye better accompte of (if we haue regarde to ſpirituall bleſſings) than Pagans or brute beaſtes. Than whiche eſtate doubtleſſe, eſpeciallye of a man that is baptized and glorieth in the name of <hi>CHRISTE,</hi> nothyng can bée ſayde or thoughte, more wretched or myſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

               <p>The manne that hathe eyther no Faith in hym at all, or ſuche as is verye ſlender and vnperfecte, neyther vſeth to ſtirre vppe, to nouriſhe, to encreaſe, and confirme the ſame by reading and meditating of the worde of <hi>GOD:</hi> that manne (I ſaye) whatſoeuer he bée, looketh in vaine to receiue anye ſpirituall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites at <hi>GODS</hi> hande. But that Faith do we affirme to be nothing, or as ſlight and ſlender a thing as maye be, whiche onelye is <hi>implicita,</hi> that is to ſaye, <hi>inuolued</hi> or <hi>enwrapped,</hi> ſuche I meane as is faſt fixed and locked vppe in the breaſte of an other manne, but hath no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of place in thine owne.

               <p>
                  <hi>This truelye is the cauſe of all calamities, that a great number can no skill to alleadge fitte teſtimonyes of Scripture for matters in queſtion. For the ſimple in that place is not to be taken for the Foole, and for hym that knoweth nothing at all:</hi>

In theſe dayes are to be ſéene euery where greate ſwarmes of Hipocrites, falſe teachers, and enuious me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche doe breake into the Lords field by night, and there ſow darnell.

Our firſte Parentes <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> whome God had adorned as well with perfite righteouſneſſe, as alſo with a moſt plentifull knowledge of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and many other ſpirituall graces, were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding beguiled of the ſubtil ſerpent: and euen forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with (withoute any great ſtriuing) gaue conſent to hys treacheries and illuſions. How and by what meanes therefore may we warrant our ſelues, that we ſhall in no caſe be inſnared or intangled, when as we are both farre more weake than they: and the old ſerpente dothe nowe no leſſe craftily than in times paſt endeuoure by Heretikes and falſe teachers to intrap and circumuent vs? He then may ſéeme rightly to be out of his wittes, and euen to ſtriue with reaſon it ſelfe, whoſoeuer fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not ne ſtandeth in doubte of ſuche a daunger. And ſoothly, that thou mayeſt arme thy ſelfe ſubſtancially againſt all peſtilent opinions, that thou mayſt be able to auoyde, to preuente, and beate backe the ſtrokes of the aduerſaries, who ſéeke on euery ſide, with the enue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed dartes of wicked arguments, to aſſayle and ſet vpon thée, and mayſt ſtande ſo faſt, and perſeuer ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanquiſhable in ſound doctrine, as is moſt méete and requiſite, thou haſt néede to put on ſpirituall weapons, the ſhield of faith, the helmet of ſaluation, but eſpecially the ſword of the ſpirit, which is the word of God, as the Apoſtle teacheth and commaundeth in the ſixte of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21011:88"/>Ephe. But thus doth he arme and defend himſelfe, that dayly and duly heareth, readeth, meditateth, learneth the worde of <hi>GOD</hi> ſet forth in the bookes of holy Scripture. For the Apoſtle Paul in the ſecond Epiſtle to Timothy and third Chapter, ſayth very well, <hi>that the Scripture is profitable to reproue and confute thoſe, that caſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode the nettes of falſe opinions, goe about to beguyle, to maske, and deſtroy the vnwary and weake.</hi> What doctrine ſoeuer is firſt brought in, it is neceſſarye that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame be tried by the touchſtone of the holy Scripture as by a moſt abſolute rule. And there are to be found euery where in the ſacred bookes, as wel exhortations, which do plainely ſhewe, with what great héedfulneſſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of ſects are to be auoyded, as alſo counſels and certaine reaſons, whyche doe no leſſe euidently declare, how wiſely and circumſpectlye the ſame ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. Whych things do verye plainely proue, that it is a moſt vaine toy, that a number (to beguile ſimple peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple withall) do oft times iangle off, and haue continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their mouthes, reading of the Scriptures, doe by &amp; by become Heretickes. But this ſpeach is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be abhorred and abandoned than to be anſwered. For what other thing elſe is this, than to ſaye, that the Phiſicke wiſely giuen and miniſtred of <hi>GOD</hi> himſelfe, is poyſon: and that ſickneſſe &amp; death is procured by that thing which is prouided to the furtherance of health and preſeruation of life? Shall we thinke him that we haue oftentimes ſpoken off, <hi>Iohn Chriſoſtome,</hi> to haue bene beſide himſelfe, and voyde of reaſon, who following the iudgement of the Apoſtle, by howe muche more he ſawe many Hereſies to growe vppe in his time, and in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the diſeaſe called the canker to créepe further and further: by ſo muche more thought it neceſſarie to haue his hearers admoniſhed that they ſhoulde diligently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelues to the reading of the holye Scriptures?
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:21011:88"/>There were in déede at that time no ſmall number of Heretikes, as namely the <hi>Manichees,</hi> the <hi>Anomaeans,</hi> the <hi>Arians, Aetians, Eunomians, Valentinians,</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites,</hi> the <hi>Marcellians</hi> and <hi>Sabellians,</hi> the <hi>Acoluthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s:</hi> there were (to be ſhort) Gentiles, and ſuch as following the Emperoure <hi>Iulianus,</hi> had reuolted from the Tentes of the Chriſtians: for with all theſe it is euident that hée encountred, by ſharpning his penne againſte them: and ſo much the rather for that they vnmeaſurably vexed the Churches of Conſtantinople, and elſe where ouer all <hi>Greece,</hi> and verye manye menne (being otherwiſe not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill) were ſeduced by them. This neceſſitie therefore draue the moſt vigilant Biſhoppe, to ſtirre vp all mens mindes, as well by bookes notoriouſly written, as alſo by publike preachings and Sermons, to the continuall reading of the propheticall and Apoſtolicke wrytings: as wée haue more than once or twice here alreadye. And in one place hée pronounceth, that is we intende to reſiſte Hereſies, and to deſcerne the true Churche from the conuenticles of Heretikes, we haue néede eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (to the doing of it) of the ayde and furtheraunce of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Hys words in the expoſition of the foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Cha. of Math. Homilie <hi>49.</hi> are theſe: <hi>In theſe dayes, ſince Hereſie inuaded the Churches, there can no triall bee hadde of true Chriſtianitie: neyther is there any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuge for Chriſtians, deſirous to knowe the variety of Fayth, than the holy Scripture of GOD. Before indeed it was ſhewed many wayes, whych was the Churche of CHRIST, and whiche was Gentilitie: but nowe it can no waye bee knowen of anye, whyche is the true Churche of CHRIST, but onely by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And why? Bycauſe that all theſe thyngs whyche are properlye Chriſtes in trueth, thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies haue alſo in Schiſme: they haue Churches alike,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21011:89"/>and the holy Scriptures themſelues, they haue Biſhops alike, and other orders of Clearkes, they haue Baptiſme alike, they haue the Euchariſt alike, and al other things, and finally euen Chriſt himſelfe. A man therefore deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know which is the true Chuche of Chriſt, howe ſhall he knowe in ſo great a confuſion of likeneſſe, but only and alone by the Scriptures? Againe before tyme the Churche of Chriſt was knowen by hir very maners and conditions, when the conuerſation of Chriſtians, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of al, or of the moſt was holy and blameleſſe, which was not ſo among the vngodly. But nowe Chriſtians are become as euill, or worſe, than are the Heretikes or Gentiles. For, to ſay the truth, there is greater continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie founde among them, though in ſchiſme, then among the Chriſtians. He therefore that will knowe whiche is the true Church of Chriſt, how ſhal he know, but only by the Scriptures? The Lord knowing then that ſo great a confuſion of things ſhould happen in the later times, therefore commaundeth, that the Chriſtians, whiche are in the ſtate of Chriſtianitie, and deſirous to embrace the ſtedfaſtneſſe of the true faith, ſhould haue recourſe to no other thing, than to the Scriptures. Otherwiſe, if they ſhall haue regard to any other matters, they ſhal be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and periſhe, not vnderſtanding whiche the true Church is.</hi> Thus much there. Yea moreouer the ſame Father is bold to ſay, that Hereſies doe then chiefelye budde forth, when men neglect to reade the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>A great defence and bulwarke againſt ſinne</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in his 3. Homilie of Lazarus, is the reading of the Scriptures: a great downefall, a daungerous pitte, is the ignorance of the Scriptures: a greate loſſe of ſaluation it is, to know nothing of Gods lawes: this thing hathe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred hereſies, this thing hathe broughte in corrupte life, this thing hath turned all things vpſide downe. For it can not be, no, it can not be I ſay, that any man ſhould
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21011:89"/>depart without fruite, that is delighted with the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall reading of the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The counſel therfore that (we ſée) <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> gaue, the ſelfe ſame (no doubte) did other of the holye fathers giue alſo, as <hi>Origen, Hierome, Auguſtine,</hi> and ſuche like, who then eſpecially exhorted al men to the reading of the Scriptures, when as Hereſies euery where wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed rife. In theſe ſentences then as well of the Apoſtle Paul, and alſo of Chriſoſtome, and others, laying forthe the lawfull vſe of the holy Scriptures, we wil willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſte: and if any ſhall be founde hereafter to the high reproche and ſlaunder of <hi>GODS</hi> diuine maieſtie, to crye out, that the ſacred Scripture doth miniſter matter and occaſion of Hereſie, thoſe (vnleſſe they wil be conuicted of high treaſon againſt the holye <hi>GHOST,</hi> the author of the holye bookes) we will commaunde and charge to hold their peace. But if they ſhal go forward to ſpeake blaſphemies againſte the holy <hi>GHOST,</hi> then will wée with the martyre <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> (for ſo doth <hi>Iuſtine</hi> write of him to <hi>Florinus</hi>) ſtoppe our eares with our fingers, and turning vnto <hi>GOD,</hi> ſaye: O merciful <hi>GOD,</hi> what tymes haſt thou brought vs into, that we ſhould heare theſe things? If euer at any time, then vndoubtedlye at this time, which ingendreth ſectes not a fewe, whereby the ignorant multitude is infected, it were to be proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that out of the moſt plentifull ſtorehouſe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>GHOST</hi> againſt the peſtilent ayre of wicked opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all good men would diligentlye procure to themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in time, preſeruatiue remedies, gathered out of the moſt excellent rules of the olde and newe Teſtamente, whiche in déede ought to be preferred before all maner of coſtly and ſwéet ſmelling ſpices whatſoeuer. Where if ſo bée anye malapert merchaunt or craftye couſiner, be founde to abuſe the Scriptures of themſelues moſte notable and moſt holeſome, to his own and other mens
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21011:90"/>deſtruction, there can nothing here truely be imputed to the Scriptures: but what euill or miſchiefe ſo euer bée taken, it muſte of neceſſitie be aſcribed to the peruerſe nature of men, as well of the deceiuers as of the decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. There is nothing at any time ſo excellent, profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and holeſome, that Satan, and his Diſciples, dare not ſubtilly counterfayte, and apply to another end than it ought to be, but eſpecially to do hurt. Euil men make the ayre, ſunne, fire, water, earth, meate, drinke, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come hurtfull vnto them, when they will not vſe them aright. The like iudgement is to be giuen of the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> which in the holy Scriptures is called a light, a lanterne, breade, meate, foode, fire. But indéed, like as the Apoſtle ſaith that he preacheth <hi>CHRIST</hi> crucified, vnto all that are called both of the Iewes &amp; Grecians, <hi>the power of GOD and wiſdome of GOD,</hi> albeit the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly either Iewes or Gentiles ſhould neuer ſo muche be offended and laugh him to ſcorn: euen ſo is the courſe of our talke directed to the commendation of <hi>GODS</hi> worde, to the intente the Godlye minded may receyue life thereby: though the wicked and vngodly do ſnatch it, and violentlye wreſt it how and whitherſoeuer they liſt themſelues.</p>
               <p>Againe howe many Chriſtians may we finde,<note place="margin">There is no Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that ſtandeth not in neede to be reproued for his ſinnes, and oft times to be admoniſhed.</note> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doe not now and then diuerſe wayes ouerſhoote the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues, and fowly alſo fall? <hi>If we ſay that we haue no ſin, we deceiue our ſelues, and ther is no truth in vs,</hi> as ſaith <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto it behoueth vs al to ſubſcribe. For why, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that euen the ſaints alſo do pray dayly, as oure Lord and maiſter <hi>CHRIST</hi> hath taught and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſaying: <hi>Forgiue vs our debtes.</hi> And the excellent Prophete Dauid Pſal. <hi>33.</hi> ſayeth, that all the holy ones ſhall cal continually vpon <hi>GOD,</hi> to obtayne pardon for their ſinnes <hi>I wil acknowledge,</hi> ſayth he, <hi>my ſinnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:21011:90"/>the Lorde, and thou haſt pardoned my vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For this cauſe ſhall all the godly pray vnto thee.</hi> Wherefore there is no man liuing, that ſtandeth not in néede oft times of a controller, or Iudge, which may diligently admoniſh, rebuke, chaſten, and bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to order. But if it ſo fall out that men dare not reproue thée being a ſinner, or they vouchſafe it not, or they doe it not ſo franckly and courteouſly as were to be wiſhed, and that peraduenture, bycauſe thou art grieued if any doe deale with thée in that order: then truely there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth this only aduice, namely, that thou reade with an attentiue minde, the preceptes contained in the holye Scriptures, the ſentences, the threatnings vttered of <hi>GOD</hi> againſte ſinners, likewiſe the Sermons of the Prophetes and Apoſtles, wherin the ſinnes of all men and therefore thine alſo are openly and ſeuerely repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: &amp; humbly tranſfer vnto thy ſelf, whatſoeuer things thou findeſt agréeable to thy ſtate. By this meanes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen alone thou maiſt in good earneſt be brought to the knowledge of thy ſinnes, from this (knowledge) ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repentaunce, and from repentance (finally) to faith and amendment of life. Adde moreouer that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doth finde out and condemne thoſe ſecret ſinnes in thée, which men know not off, and which thou wouldeſt be aſhamed to confeſſe, and ſo coulde neuer be reproued by the liuely ſounding voyce of any man. Therfore the holy Scripture when thou readeſt it, ſpeaketh only vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée alone: it is a faithful kéeper of thy ſecrets, it wil admoniſh thée of moſt weyghty affayres, it wil not put into thy minde but thoſe things that are excellent, and of whiche peraduenture thou ſhouldſt neuer haue heard anye thing of any man liuing. For in good ſooth this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry worde whileſt it is reuerently and with a feruent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection read, or heard recited of another, beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth quick and mighty in operation, ſo that it pearceth to the very
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21011:91"/>marow of the bones, and to the innermoſt entrayles of the heart, and euen leaueth behynde it certaine ſtrings ſticking faſt of long tyme after in the minds of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: whiche thyng to be true Sainct Auguſtine in his booke of Confeſſions, and other holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do auouch, that they haue tryed by experience. And <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtome</hi> in his thirde Sermon of <hi>Lazarus</hi> preſumeth to ſaye, <hi>That men euen only by the outwarde viewe of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bookes are afrayde to commit ſinne: and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the ſpirituall books are, from thence is expelled the force of the Diuell, and all things become there ſafe and ſound.</hi> But he that heareth not <hi>GOD</hi> in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by a certaine priuye violence, but yet with great &amp; abſolute authoritie, briefely ripping vp ſinnes though neuer ſo ſecret and hidden: how will he heare man when he accuſeth, controlleth, or alſo (by a certain graue kind of ſpeaking) condemneth them? But if there be any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that neyther admitteth man to be his counſeller, nor yet hearkeneth vnto <hi>GOD</hi> continually ſpeaking in the Scriptures: that ſuch a one from his hearte ſhoulde be a Chriſtian, no man (I am ſure) but he that is ouer lightly carried away with wordes, and willingly ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe to be deceyued, wil euer graunt or allow. Therefore to the intente thou mayſt declare, that thou arte (at the leaſt) vnfeynedly ſory for that thou remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt faſt fettered in the bandes of ſinne, and that thou coueteſt to heare <hi>GOD</hi> louingly and with a fatherlye affection talking with thée, admoniſhing thée, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thée backe into the righte waye before thou be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroyed: thou wilt, if thou wiſe be, invre thy ſelfe dayly to reade the holy Scriptures, and in them as in a glaſſe beholde, and learne more familiarly to knowe, not ſo muche what <hi>GOD</hi> is, as what thou thy ſelf art.<note place="margin">No Christian ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be without comfortes.</note>

               <p>But howe large a fielde ſhoulde be opened, incaſe I mighte ſpeake of conſolations, whereof in the holye
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21011:91"/>Scripture are expreſſed innumerable, and the ſame moſt certayne and ſound? For albeit Philoſophye hathe nowe long ſince béene commended of hir retayners for many cauſes, but eſpeciallye for that ſhe miniſtreth in aduerſitie a preſent comforte: yet are all Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call reaſons found to be very faint, barren, colde, weak, if they be compared with thoſe whyche the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do afford.

For to this ende eſpecially is the Scripture before all other diſciplines put foorth that it mighte ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in the families and aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blies of wretched creatures the moſte néedefull and commendable office of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

               <p>Therefore, O yée Chriſtians all,<note place="margin">The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> of what ſtate or condition ſoeuer ye bée, I hartily pray and beſéeche you by the precious bloud of our Lord and Sauiour <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> that yée woulde throughly perſwade youre ſelues, that the things whiche haue hitherto of me bin treated of, do tende firſt to the ſanctifying and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Gods name héere on earth, and next to the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp of euery one of you, to the intente you maye become diligente in procuring the buſineſſe of youre owne euerlaſting ſaluation. For in very déede euerye mannes owne proper cauſe is here handled. And it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth vs all oftetimes to conſider, that the Churche is a publike and common Schoole, inſtituted of <hi>GOD</hi> oure heauenly father, wherein the moſte excellent tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of trueth the holye Ghoſte teacheth and profeſſeth of frée coſt, and louingly allureth vs all vnto him.

For he that doeth daylye in expounding, reading, hearing, and repeating of it diligently exerciſe hymſelfe, and be a meane to prouoke others to doe the lyke, hée declareth hymſelfe indéede to be the Scholler of <hi>GOD,</hi> and to be well worthye of prayſe and commendation. But on the other ſide, who ſoeuer he be that refuſeth to reade, heare and learne the ſayde Booke, alſo cauſeth others to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine from the ſame, he doeth not obſcurely ſignifye, that hée is of hys father the Diuell.

Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine reporteth in his fifte Epiſtle to <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> that there was a man on a tyme, throughe a certaine medicine miniſtred by the excellent Phiſition <hi>Vindici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi> reſtored to health, after a fewe yeares when the verye ſame ſickeneſſe came againe, the ſicke partie withoute aſking any counſell of the Phiſition, vſed the ſelfe ſame medicine (as before:) but it did him no good.

In like manner therefore, for ſo muche as we haue hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto with ſundrye and playne argumentes declared, that it is the office of euery Chriſtian, dayly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallye to reade, heare, and learne ſomething out of the holye Bible: it remayneth nowe that we ſpecifye and demonſtrate, howe and by what meanes a man maye readily, and without any trouble or thinking of the time long, ſo take in hande, and poynte out thys office of reading euerie daye of the wéeke, as that in a yeares ſpace, he maye well reade and pervſe ouer all the holy Bookes, eſpecially ſo many as the olde and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Churche hathe auouched to be Canonicall. Wée haue indéede tarried longer in the former Booke than we were aware of, inaſmuch as no man is ignorante, that there is a more laboure and diligence required of vs, when mens minds are firſt of all to be prepared and inflamed vnto any thing, ſéeming ſtrange in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the vnlearned multitude, and hard to outwarde appearance (neyther truly ſhall it repente vs eyther of oure trauell, or long ſtanding, if we maye by ſome meanes bring that to paſſe whyche we couet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire) but in the matters following, we wyll bée more briefe: as alſo the thing it ſelfe, of whiche wée haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſpeake, maye well be diſpatched in fewer wordes.</p>
               <p>Whoſoeuer hée be therefore,<note place="margin">The willing mind eaſilie findeth opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to do well,</note> that is truely, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede ſo carefull of hys owne ſoules health, as he would bée counted, and knoweth aſſuredly, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods wyll out of the holy Scriptures, is very requiſite and neceſſarie to ſaluation: that manne maye eaſilie (if he liſt) finde oportunitie to reade, and enſearch the ſame. The thyng that a man hathe once

It is no hard matter wyth vs to deuiſe a way, whereby at one time or other wée maye enioy that whiche we gréedily gape for.

                  </hi> in whyche the powers of the ſenſes are ſo damnified and hurte, that the patientes, for ſo muche as they are continuallye attached wyth a kynde of heauineſſe and feare, doe imagine what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they ſée, to be ſharpe, bitter, and altogyther agaynſte them: wherefore they haue in ſuſpition and ielouſy all thynges that are done or ſayde, and doe eſchue and abhorre the preſence and company of men: but yet after a while they are healed and deliuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thys maladie.

Moreouer, there is no let to the contrarie, but that thou mayſt now and then, to auoyde yrkeſomneſſe, chaunge places. For thou mayſt very wel reade in thy chamber, when as eyther thou riſeſt in the morning, or goeſt to bed at night: in the Churche, when there is eyther no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or very little out of the Scriptures (as it oftimes commeth to paſſe) red or expounded to the people, in thy parlour, ſo long as thy dinner or ſupper is in makyng readie, vntill thou be about to take thy meate, whileſt the diſhes are brought too or carried from the table: in thy Studie, in thy garden, to be ſhort, whereſoeuer thou wilt and art diſpoſed.

For as the mouth that is out of taſte, can not away with anye meate thoughe neuer ſo deintie and holeſome: but when it is recouered, is refreſhed there with, and can ſcarcely be ſatiſfied: ſo when a man beginneth firſt to read the holy ſcriptures, he quickly loatheth them: but when he hath once taſted the ſwéeteneſſe of the ſpirituall doctrine, then he féeleth dayly more and more all things to become more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant &amp; acceptable vnto him, and then ſingeth he with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Octauius</hi> the Emperour (if we maye credite <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>) in a moſte cruell battaile holden at <hi>Mutina</hi> a Citie of <hi>Gallia,</hi> read, wrote, and declaymed dayly: in the night time being awaked oute of ſléepe, he vſed a reader of Commentaries: and when he was at home, he would recite certaine writings of his owne to his familiar friends, as vnto hearers in the Schooles, <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> as he happily fought ſundry battells, ſo put he the ſame himſelfe as elegantly in writing, and that euen in his Tentes, in the noiſe of Trumpettes, and in the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed clattering of armour and weapons, ſo farre foorthe that a man maye doubte, by whether of the two things he attained greater commendation. And before thys man, <hi>Cato Cenſorius,</hi> famous for his ſkil both of warre and peace, read very much, year learned the Gréeke tong perfectlye, when he was an olde man, as afterwarde his graundchilde, whome they called <hi>Vticenſis,</hi> way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Courte till the Senate ſhoulde come togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hadde his Bookes with him, leaſte any parte of the hour-glaſſe ſhoulde come forth without fruite. <hi>Plinius Veronenſis,</hi> albeit hée was intangled with the affaires of the Courte, of the lawe, and of warfare, yet didde hée neuer refraine hymſelfe from Philoſophie, and from the inſearching of hidden thyngs, but whither he were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his meate, or iorneying, or doing of ſome other

               <p>Nowe ſith it is euident,<note place="margin">That a time certain, ought to be giuen to the reading of the Scriptures</note> that no excuſe or allegation whatſoeuer wyll goe for payment, it is méete and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that euery man doe ſo diſtribute the times &amp; houres of hys actions, as of them he may giue ſome daylye to the ſearching of the writings of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. And in good ſooth it is not likely, that the thinges ſhoulde otherwiſe be well done, that are not accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in order, and in a tyme appointed. Some things are fit to be done in the nighte, otherſome in the dawning, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſome in the morning, otherſome at noonetide, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in the euening.

But why doe we not rather turne our conſideration vnto Chriſtian princes? Therefore to ſpeake of <hi>Alfred</hi> king of <hi>Britain,</hi> who firſt of all founded the famous ſchole at <hi>Oxforde,</hi> we finde it recorded, that he in like manner diſſeuered all the time into thrée portions, and gaue eight houres dayly to the minde, to read, pray, and meditate in: other eight to the adminiſtration of his kingdome, and the reſidue to bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily exerciſes. Not muche vnlike vnto this man was <hi>Charles</hi> the great, who vſed to féed his minde with good ſtudies and meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but eſpecially with the reading of the holy Scriptures: and (which not a fewe haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of him) in the time of dinner and ſupper he wold alwayes haue ſome things recyted as well out of the ſacred Bible, as alſo out of the workes of Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine. It is plain and euident, that many other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces mo beſides, haue in learning the duties of godlynes out of the holy Scriptures, troden the ſalfe ſame pathe. Why do not euery one of vs therefore after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of ſo worthy men, eſpecially of <hi>Alfred</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> kings that deſerued excéedinglye wel of Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, take counſel by &amp; by, as touching ordinary houres to be appointed to the reading of the holy Bible? I doe very willingly, and euen purpoſely, rehearſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> factes of kings and princes in this cauſe: partly to the intent the kings, princes, and noble men of our days may perceiue that they alſo are prouoked by the authoritie &amp; prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſidents of their aunceſtours to the like diligence in learning the doctrine of religion: and partly, to the ende that inferioure perſons, who are by no meanes like princes ſurcharged and in a maner ouerwhelmed with the waues of manifolde and difficult affayres, may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,

               <p>Be it therefore concluded and determined, that it is no harde matter for any Chriſtian, to finde fit places, times, and houres to pervſe ouer the bookes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Philoſophy, that at leaſtwiſe conſidering what other excellent men haue done in the ſame matter, will not ſticke valiantlye to pricke forwarde himſelfe to the doing of the like.</p>

For why, all things that ſhall once in this behalfe reuerently be decréede, are, as by an inuiolable lawe, and yet withoute ſuperſtition, to be reteyned and kepte. And if at any time peraduenture ſome odde buſineſſe, and vnlooked for, doe fall out to the contrary, then it behoueth theé very carefully to prouide, that at ſome other tyme the want be ſupplied.</p>

               <p>Out of all theſe bookes a man maye lawfullye fetche proofes and allegations to fortify and confyrme the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of religion, and they are in authoritie before the other bookes and fragments which are called <hi>Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,</hi> and be in leſſe price: wherefore we ſhall not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good cauſe beſtowe our greateſt care and diligence in reading and learning of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Therefore in this wiſe and order I iudge they maye once or oftner in a yeares ſpace readilye and without trouble be red.</p>
               <p>Now I holde beſt, that we take our beginning at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pſalter, and that it be reade apart, yea ſometimes read againe, by reaſon of the manifolde profite and vtilitie thereof. For it is manifeſt, that in it is contained as yée woulde ſaye an <hi>Epitome</hi> or abridgement of the whole Scripture.</p>
               <p>Therefore there is offred alwayes in it that which maye profitablye be learned, there commeth alwayes next to hande ſomething whereby the minde in ſo great plentye and varietie of things maye be refreſhed: and therefore is the one only booke of the Pſalmes before al other thought worthy to bée learned, yea and to be ka<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by hart of all men.</p>
               <p>This booke moreouer conſiſteth of prayers prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for euerye euent and purpoſe: of thankeſgiuing, it minſtreth doctrine of greate importaunce and excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:21011:102"/>there be in it exhortations ſharpe and ſeuere: it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth with moſt ſwéete conſolations: yea al things are ſo handled and deliuered in it, that in euerye parte thereof both the glorie of <hi>GOD</hi> is celebrated and ſet forth, and the minde of man informed to godlyneſſe of life and conuerſation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore euen they alſo are wonte that abſteyne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other books of holy ſcripture, not vnwillingly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelues in reading &amp; reciting dayly both mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and euening certaine of the Pſalmes.</p>
               <p>Which things ſéeing they are thus, we do not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good cauſe and conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſet down our aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment apart by it ſelfe, as touching the reading and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanciall learning of the Pſalmes.</p>
               <p>Now the Pſalmes doe amount in number to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty: and the whole yeare conſiſteth of two &amp; fiftie wéekes &amp; one day. If therfore thou be diſpoſed to reade ouer the booke of Pſalmes once in a yeares ſpace, thou ſhalt read euery wéeke thrée Pſalmes: ſo ſhal there remayn two wéeks to ſpare: or if thou wilt, thou maiſt pervſe only two Pſalmes, in euery of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt <hi>6.</hi> wéekes.</p>
               <p>But if thou be determined to read ouer the Pſalmes twice in one yeare, then ſhalt thou reade euery wéeke ſixe Pſalmes, which will moſt conueniently be done, if thou repeate euery day, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords day, one Pſalme. Howbeit ſo againe will be left two wéekes voyde, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe peraduenture it liketh thée in euerye of the foure laſte wéekes to reade only thrée Pſalmes.</p>
               <p>Where, if incaſe now, by obſeruing the ſelfſame or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thou wilt recite euerye wéeke nine Pſalmes, then ſhalte thou reade ouer the whole Pſalter thrice in one yeare, vſing a <hi>Prouiſo</hi> in the meane time, that in ſome of the latter wéekes thou diſtribute the number of the Pſalmes, according to the proportion ſpecified in the premiſſes.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:21011:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Albeit thou mayſt alſo in ſuche wiſe diuide and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate this labour, as namely in one wéeke thou mayſt recyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> eight Pſalmes: and in an other nine, and ſo goe on with like proportion to the reſte: and at the length thou ſhalt perceyue fiftéene Pſalmes to be kept in ſtore to the laſt wéeke.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, when thou ſhalt be minded to reade ouer the booke of Pſalmes foure times in a yeare, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that thou reade euerye wéeke eleuen Pſalmes: and in euery of the foure laſt wéekes, fiftéene Pſalmes, and ſo there will remayne one only daye frée from reading. Thou ſéeſt therefore an eaſye and open waye, whereby thou mayſte in twelue monthes ſpace reade ouer the whole booke of the Pſalmes once, or twice, or thrice, or fouretimes, euen as thou lyſt thy ſelfe. And is this ſo greate and troubleſome a labour, wherein thou accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomeſt to ſaye thrée Pſalmes in a wéeke, or euery daye one or two Pſalmes, and the one perhaps in ſteade of a prayer in the morning when thou riſeſt, and the other at nighte when thou goeſt to bed?</p>
               <p>Let vs procéed now in like maner to the other bookes called Canonicall. There are founde in theſe ſeauen hundred thréeſcore and ſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a man wil reade euery wéeke fiftéene Chapters, he ſhal diſpatch al bookes which a litle before we num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, once in a yeares ſpace, and there ſhall remayne two dayes onlye to ſpare. And it will be a very eaſye matter to diſpatch the reading of fiftéene Chapters, if in ſome one day of the ſeauen thou repeate thrée Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and in euery of the reſt twayne. Who is hée there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that can iuſtly complayne, that hée hath euen by this meanes an ouer heauye and importable burthen layde vpon him? Nowe then, as it ſhall pleaſe thée to multiply the number of the Chapter: ſo will it be eaſye for thée to accompte, how and in what order thou maiſt

               <p>But in what eſtimation, ſayeth ſome man, ſhall the bookes called <hi>Apocrypha</hi> be had? Shall it be good to ſpende any time in reading of them alſo? Why ſhoulde wée not, ſay I, whenſoeuer oportunitie ſerueth, euen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily reade them? Or if it pleaſe thée to applye the reading of them to certaine peculiar tymes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is no let but thou mayſt do it.

               <p>The Chapters in all are two hundred &amp; thrée ſcore. For in what place the Epiſtles of <hi>Peter</hi> the ſeconde, of <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſeconde and thirde, and one of <hi>Iude,</hi> deſerue to be put, I do not nowe diſpute, who profeſſe my ſelfe to followe the common opinion, or rather cuſtome.</p>
               <p>Now if thou readeſt euery wéeke in the Newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament fiue Chapters, thou ſhalt go thorough with it once in a tweluemonths ſpace. If thou pervſe ouer ten Chapters, thou ſhalt go thorough w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it twice, and one only day ſhal be left to ſpare. If fiftéene Chapters, thou ſhalt accompliſhe it thrice. If twentie, thou ſhalte ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it foure times.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus declared, it remayneth that euery godly man do repute with himſelfe, howe oft hée will reade ouer the holy Pſalmes, howe ofte the bookes of the olde Teſtament, howe oft the newe Teſtamente in a yeares ſpace.</p>
               <p>Of whiche pointe when he hath once determined, then ſhall it be néedefull for him to limit out the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the bookes according to the wéekes and dayes of the yeare, after that forme and order whiche wée haue ſhewed in the premiſſes.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, partly to the intent the godlie diſpoſed may the more willingly and eaſilye imbrace our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle and aduice, partly leaſte thoſe that haue alreadye attempted to reade dayly the holye Byble at houres ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, ſhould alleage for excuſe, that they do (ſooner than a man would thinke) fayle and miſſe in the order or number of the Chapters: I haue prouided a Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, wherein for euery daye in euery moneth are noted and ſet downe certaine Chapters, as wel of the worke of the Pſalmes, as of the other bookes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> old and new Teſtament, and the ſame truely ſo digeſted and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in number, that thou mayſte verye well reade and pervſe ouer once or oftner in a yeare, as thou thinkeſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21011:105"/>good, al the ſaid bookes of the holy Bible, or at leaſtwiſe ſo many of them as thou haſt moſt fancie to, and canſt beſt like of. And in this order is this Calendar made.</p>
               <p>Firſt and foremoſt we haue giuen to euerye moneth two litle pages or ſides of a leafe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one anſwering to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, and either of them with lines from aboue drawn directly downewarde diſſeuered and diuided into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes or pillers.</p>
               <p>In the former page of the left ſide are drawen two ſuche lines, betwéen which, for as muche as they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and make a very ſmall and ſlender piller, there is no greater ſpace or diſtaunce, than that by deſcending from the heade to the foote, the letters <hi>A.b.c.d e.f g.A b.c., &amp;c:</hi> whereby are wont to be noted in common Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendars the ſpaces of the wéekes and number of the dayes, maye be writen. But before this ſame piller, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the left ſide, there are ſet down certaine notes of numbers, which whileſt they aunſwere to the ſayde letters, doe at the firſte ſighte declare, what day of the moneth euerye daye in the wéeke is. From the ſeconde line to the vttermoſt parte of the ſame ſide towarde the right hande, is a great deale of ſpace left, wherein who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer liſt, maye at his owne choyce and libertie, note the publike feaſts and holydayes hapning throughout the whole yeare. Though I, who am fully reſolued to conſecrate this labour whatſoeuer it bée to the reading of the Scriptures, and for this cauſe haue willinglye called it a Calendar of the holy Scripture, do ſet downe the things memorable, whiche the holy bookes reporte to be done on certaine dayes: adding alſo ſome things in ſome places, whiche the opinion onely of the learned warranteth to be done on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame dayes: of which ſort are, the natiuitie and death of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> the murther of <hi>Stephen,</hi> the calling of <hi>Paule,</hi> &amp;c. as touching whych
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:21011:105"/>things verile the holy Scripture expreſſeth no certain dayes, and yet by the common conſentes of all menne there are ſome certaine dayees appointed.</p>
               <p>Thus much of the former <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>age.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide or page, which ſtretcheſh towarde the right hande, there follow foure other diſtaunces or pillers, marked out with fiue lines let downe to rights in manner of a plum line.</p>
               <p>And of all of them well néere the bredth is alike, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that the firſt is diſcerned to be ſomwhat narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Whiche firſt is appointed only to the worke of the Pſalmes, and it conteyneth in ſuche wiſe the number and order of Pſalmes affixed on certaine dayes, as all men may pervſe them ouer once euerye yeare. But if a man be diſpoſed to reade them twice, or thrice, or fouretymes in a yere, there is no cauſe to the contrary but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he by his own choyce and induſtry, multiplying the numbers of the Pſalmes according to the rate and proportion of euery wéeke, may frame to himſelfe papers with columnes or pillers correſpondent, and &amp; fixe them in a table to his own vſe, concerning which thing we haue touched ſomewhat alſo aboue. Next fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the ſeconde Columne, wherein are placed the bookes of the olde Teſtament, whiche our aunceſters, the moſt holy gouernours of Churches, haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be Canonicall.</p>
               <p>The names therefore of theſe bookes we haue ſette downe in a decent order, and likewiſe what and howe manye Chapters of them maye conuently be reade e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye daye. The third Columne we haue giuen to the bookes of the Olde Teſtamente no numbred in the Canon, wherof the titles and Chapters are in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber certaine diſtributed throughout the wéekes of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye moneth. And we haue purpoſelye ſundered theſe bookes from the former, neyther woulde wée
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:21011:106"/>mingle them togither in one and the ſelfeſame diſtance. For it came to my remembraunce to feare, that that woulde not onely haue bin vnſéemely, but alſo to ſome very gréeuous. For what, if ſome mans ſtomacke could not well brooke the Bookes of the latter kinds or at leaſt not thinke them worthy the reading euery yere?</p>
               <p>Truely I for my parte will interprete my ſucceſſe to be happy, and my labour and diligence not to be vtterly loſte, if ſo be I ſhall obtaine but thus muche of good folkes, namely, that they will euen once in a yere reade ouer all the Canonicall Bookes. Furthermore, the fourth columne is dedicated to all the Bookes, whyche are nowe euery where (by a cuſtome receiued) aſcribed to the new Teſtament: the Chapters whereof we haue in ſuch wiſe digeſted and diſpoſed, as that they may once in a yeares ſpace be read ouer without any paines. But if any mans minde ſhall be inflamed with ſo ſeruent a deſire of reading the holy myſteries, that he wyll aſſay to attempt greater matters, and like as the Pſalmes, ſo peraduenture alſo couet to go through a twice or thrice wyth the Canonical Bookes of the olde and newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, it ſhall be an eaſie matter for him, by doubling the numbers whiche we haue put, or by conueying them ſomewhat otherwiſe, to deuiſe an other way fit and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for hys purpoſe, and to make another Calendar.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, aboue theſe Columnes in the pages of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery moneth, there are fixed of vs (in ſteade of pillar co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronets) certaine titles. The firſte and higheſt line ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended throughout both the pages, containeth the name of euery moneth in Latine and Engliſh: then next how the Hebrues do call the ſame, &amp; how many it is with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in number: finaly, howe it is termed in the Atticke tongue of the Gréeks. The line that is vnderneath this, I meane in the former page, ouer and aboue the firſte piller, hath nothing at all written on it: but ouer the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21011:106"/>ſecond and maine piller we haue noted in theſe words, <hi>THINGS DONE:</hi> and in the latter page, the firſt pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſheweth this title, <hi>PSALMES:</hi> the ſeconde &amp; third, <hi>OLDE TESTAMENT:</hi> the fourth, <hi>NEVVE.</hi> In thys wiſe therefore whileſt paſſage is made throughe the twelue moneths, there is layd open a certaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted waye, whereby in a yeares ſpace the whole booke of the Pſalmes, againe all the other Canonicall bookes of the olde Teſtamente, further, the bookes not Canonicall, laſtly al the bookes numbred in the newe Teſtament, may once very wel be read ouer. And leaſt any man ſhold want any thing herein, I haue thought good to inſerte into this booke, the whole Calender of the holy Scripture, drawen forth in that forme and order which we haue ſpoken of, and with al the pages &amp; pillers incident therevnto, ſo farforth as might bée, truelye dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou ſéeſt now, and in what ſort we haue ordeyned y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Calendar of holy Scripture, and brought it to an ende. And to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente the greater number of godlye rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders maye reape of ſwéete and continual fruite by this our labour, we haue proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Calendar, and digeſted it in ſuche wiſe, as that they may draw it forth in tables of paper or parchment, and faſten them to the wals in their ſtudie, Parlour, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie chamber, ſhoppe, chappel, Oratory, and whereſoeuer they liſt themſelues. For my parte I couet nothing ſo muche as that all the godly woulde receyue this worke with that minde, that it is of me offred. Howbeit I goe not about to preſcribe any thing as of neceſſitie to anye man, but doe franckely confeſſe that euery man oughte to be at his owne choyce and liberty, to appoint and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine more at large of and concerning all this whole buſineſſe: and therefore (hardly) let euery one chooſe ſuche a way of reading the holy myſteries, as he ſhal ſuppoſe to be moſt fitte and conuenient for his purpoſe. Yea if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſhal by his owne proper witte and induſtrie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe a more apt waye than this is, and will not be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to impart the ſame vnto vs, we proteſt that we ſhal be ſo farre of from enuying his good ſucceſſe, that we wil follow him rather for our guide and lodes man, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnto him the expreſſe meaning of a thankeful minde when and ſo farre forth as in vs ſhall lye. For why, wée truely are not aſhamed to confeſſe, that after the maner of painters, who vſe with a cole or chalke to drawe the firſt lineamentes of their worke, we haue ſhadowed out more truely than fully finiſhed, a certain ſlender and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie forme of diſtinguiſhing and limiting forthe certaine chapters of bookes to be reade euery day throughout the yeare.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:21011:120"/>
               <p>And ſoothly, of al other we couet leaſt that any thing ſhoulde in this behalfe be ſuperſtitiouſly obſerued.<note place="margin">Let a man read dayly cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine chapters, but vvithout ſu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perſtition.</note> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie is a thing of it ſelfe verye amiable: neyther is it méete, as perteyning eſpecially to this matter, that any thing ſhould in ſuch wiſe be commaunded or enioyned as though that he that did otherwiſe, ſhoulde by and by bée put in fault and blame. For doubtleſſe it is very fitte and requiſite to be permitted, that a man ſhoulde at any time of the yeare beginne the holye Bible, that he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and digeſt in ſuche order and number as well the Bookes as Chapters, as he himſelfe can beſt like off, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that he ſhoulde pervſe ſome certaine bookes out of whiche he hopeth to reade moſte profit in the doctrine of religion, ſo muche the oftner, like as <hi>Saint Ambroſe</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to reade before others the prophet Eſay, and other bookes more rarely and ſparinglye. But thys thing we are moſt of all deſirous to perſwade, that it is very neceſſarie for euery Chriſtian, that he ſhould dayly pervſe ouer certaine Chapters of the ſacred Byble. And if ſo be the ſame man ſhal once in a yere go through with the reading of the whole Byble, then we promiſe him, that ouer and beſides he ſhall deſerue no ſmal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of his godly trauell with all men, he ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reape moſte ample fruite and commoditie by this hys diligence.</p>
               <p>I woulde haue thée therefore, whatſoeuer thou art, duely to conſider with thy ſelfe, whether anye man may iuſtly hereafter alleadge for excuſe, that it will bée as greate a matter for him to read ouer the holy Bible, as a number wil ſéeme to make it.</p>
               <p>What labour, I praye thée, is it, to beſtowe one houre, or m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:21011:120"/>foure, or fiue Chapters at the moſte euerye daye in the wéeke? In good faith he maye well bluſhe and be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that dare hence forwarde ſo muche as once tomut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt theſe things. Therefore let euery manne forthwyth without anye delay make, prefix, and inionye to himſelfe a lawe, and let him with all care and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie indeauour to obey it ſo long as he liueth. But if it ſhall happen through buſineſſe falling out of the ſodayne that lawe to be broken and interrupted, then let him not ſpare (hardlye) to puniſhe, and euen to be awreaked of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>No manne is better ſtyrred vppe and reteyned in his dutie doing, than he that of his owne accorde is both a lawe and a iudge to himſelfe.

Therefore, by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer pointe, we muſt be moued, to thinke and perſwade oure ſelues, that in the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> yea, euen when it is read onelye or hearde, there is a certaine maieſtie
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:21011:125"/>and excellencie, by reaſon whereof it deſerueth to be imbraced of vs with all reuerence and lowlyneſſe of hearte.

For <hi>Ezra read in the booke of the Lawe, Nehemia: 8. in the open ſtreete that was before the watergate, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vntil midday, in the preſence of men and women that gaue heede vnto it, and the eares of all the people hearkned vnto the Booke of the Law</hi> It foloweth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after. <hi>And al the people when they heard the words of the lawe.</hi> The Apoſtle Peter, Actes. <hi>2.</hi> rehearſeth the Scriptures to the Iews, and interpreteth them as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Chriſt: which being heard, ſo many as were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent were pricked in hearte, and ſaid vnto Peter and the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles: <hi>Men and brethren what ſhal we do?</hi> And vnto the Rom <hi>10. But what ſayth it? The worde is neare thee, euen in thy mouth, and in thine hart. This is the word of Faith which we preach, to wit, if thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Ieſus, &amp; ſhalt beleeue in thine hearte that God rayſed him vp from the dead, thou ſhalte bee ſaued. For with the hearte man belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto righteouſneſſe, and wyth the mouth manne confeſſeth to ſaluation.</hi> Againe, in the ſame place:

                  <hi>Fayth commeth by hearing, and hearing by the worde of GOD.</hi> Moreouer Peter Act. <hi>10.</hi> making a plaine declaration of the ſumme of Chriſtian doctrine oute of the holy Scriptures, in the houſe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion: <hi>To this CHRIST</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>beare all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets witneſſe, that throughe his name whoſoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, ſhall receiue remiſsion of ſinnes. While Peter yet ſpake theſe wordes, the holy Ghoſte fell on al them that hearde the worde.</hi> Wée may therefore out of al queſtion confirme this aſſertion, namely, that by the diligent and attentiue reading, hearing, and meditation of the worde of <hi>GOD,</hi> a man is induced to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>GOD</hi> and of hymſelfe, to the deteſtation of his ſinnes, and to vnfayned repentaunce: to Faith in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, to the amendment of hys life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and to bée ſhorte, receiueth the holy Ghoſte, and wyth hym moſt large and bountifull giftes.

For why, if hée that beyng incenſed with deſire of profiting, taketh in hand the holy Bookes, do before al things craue the ayde of the holy Ghoſt: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> next deuoutly reade or heare the word of <hi>GOD,</hi> by which (as by an inſtrument) it pleaſeth <hi>GOD</hi> to talke famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly with vs: after this alſo lifte vp his mind vnto <hi>GOD</hi> ſpeaking by the Prophets or Apoſtles, and duly diſcuſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things ſpecified in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: there is no doubt but that God after his acuſtomed clemency putting to his hande, will ſtirre vp, purge, teach and ſanctifie the heart as well of the reader as the the hearer, and graciouſly grante vnto him Repentance, Faith, the holy Ghoſt, and other giftes and graces of hys ſpirite.</p>

But the readyeſt and moſte certayne waye of all is, to obſerue with great care and induſtrye, in Sermons made by faythfull Teachers to the people in Sacred aſſemblies, howe and by what meanes in the diſcourſe of euerye parte of the Propheticall and Apoſtolike writings, whyche are there declared, one while a manifolde Doctrine as touching true opinions, an other whyle Controle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of falſe opinions, an other while Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Exhortations vnto Vertue, an other while reprehenſions of Faultes, an other whyle Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, all them applyed to the preſente ſtate of thyngs, and (ſo farre foorthe as may be) to the times, places, and perſons, are vttered and produced, and wyth no ſmall cunning, Clearklineſſe, and indeuoure inculked and repeated.</p>
               <p>Lyke as thoſe children doe putte vs in good hope and expectation of theyr towardneſſe, whyche wée ſée willinglye and vncompelled to goe to the Schooles, wherein the fyrſte poyntes of Learning
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:21011:129"/>are taughte: ſo we dare be bolde to ſaye, that thoſe ſhall eaſily vnderſtand al the whole vſe of Chriſtian Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that do chéerefully (laying all other matters aparte) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorte to the Churche, ſo ofte as anye intreatie touchyng the Scriptures is there godlily, and purely, and ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed and made. Euery Church, wherein are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced diligent and faithfull teachers, is as a famous Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie and common Schoole for all men to come vnto. And that is wonte to be taken for moſte ſounde, and leaſte ſuſpected, whiche is publikely, and of thoſe that haue the charge of teaching in the Churche committed vnto them, giuen forth and exhibited. But I holde beſte to ſet downe héere, that whiche Saint Chriſoſtome in hys homilie <hi>21.</hi> vpon Iohn, hath wiſely pronounced as touching all thys matter. <hi>If wee woulde</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently ranſacke the Scriptures, wee might thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſaluation: if we woulde be throughly conuerſant in them, we ſhould rightly be inſtructed both in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and liuing. And albeit a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be crooked, peruerſe, and vnmerciful, albeit he hathe profited nothing afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time: yet now at leaſt wiſe ſhal he profite, and (although hee doth not by and by perceiue it) receiue ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte. For if ſo be a man ſitteth in a ſhop, where oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or perfumes be made, he doth euen whither hee will or no taſte of the ſauor thereof: then muche more he that frequenteth the Church. For euen as of ſlouth, groweth neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: ſo of exerciſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth cherefulneſſe. Though thou be ſubiect to neuer ſo many ſins, though altogither vncleane: yet refuſe thou not to come to the Church. For, what if thou doeſt not the thinges that are taughte? Thou ſhalte not loſe altogither thy labour, if thou vnderſtandeſt but thy ſelfe to be miſerable. Thys feare wil not be vnprofitable, nor this dreade out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon If thou ſob and ſigh from thy hearte, bycauſe thou doeſt not that which thou heareſt, there is no doubt but
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:21011:129"/>that thou ſhalt one day beginne to do wel. For it cannot bee, that he that both heareth GOD, and talketh wyth GOD, ſhould be without profite. For by and by we are kept vnder. We waſh our handes, when we take vp the booke. Seeſt thou with what reuerence we are moued before we reade? But if we adde diligence herevnto, then will great profit come thereby. For none but the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſoule waſheth his handes. And the wife if ſhee haue hir heade bare, couereth it ſo ſoone as may bee, giuing a token of hir inwarde reuerence: but the man if his heade be couered, will by and by diſcouer it. Seeſt thou howe the outward faſhion declareth the inward affection? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, he that is a diligent hearer of a diuine Sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, doth oft times grone in conſcience, doth oft times finde fault with his life and manners. Let vs apply our ſelues therefore to the Scriptures, my deere brethren, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Goſpels, let vs oft times be in hande wyth them. For the booke is no ſooner opened, but ſtraighte wayes we ſhall meete with the name of CHRIST: and when wee heare the order of his birth, we ſhall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Mary his mother, which of Ioſeph hir huſband was founde to be with child by the holy GHOST. Now hee that ſhall heare theſe things, will immediately be infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a wonderfull loue of virginitie, he wil maruel at the childe, he will deſpiſe earthly things. Neyther is it to be thought a matter of ſmall importaunce, that a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine was accompted worthy of the holy Ghoſte, and to be ſaluted by the meſſage of an Angel. And theſe things briefly for a taſt. But if thou wilt dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſerch through all things, thou ſhalt incontinently contemne al world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affayres, and ſhalt reioyce with thy ſelfe. If thou bee riche, thou wilt paſſe nothing for riches, when thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeſt that a poore Carpenters wife, in a vile co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and condition, became the mother of our Lorde. If thou be poore, thou needeſt not bee aſhamed, when
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:21011:130"/>thou heareſt that the authour of the worlde refuſed not a moſt vile cabin. Thus being perſwaded, thou ſhalt not be carried headlong to rauine and extortion, thou ſhalte not bee carried to couetouſneſſe, thou ſhalt not take thy neighbors good, but rather thou ſhalt imbrace pouerty, thou ſhalt deſpiſe riches, thou ſhalt by this meanes put away al malice. Againe, when thou ſhalt ſee Ieſus lying in a manger, thou wilt caſt away all care of decking thy ſonne with gold or ſiluer, of garniſhing thy bedde, thou wilt caſt away I ſaye all couetouſneſſe: thou ſhalt obtain many things, which perticularly I can not now ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to declare, but they ſhal know that will take a taſte of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherefore I exhorte that yee woulde giue attendance to reading, that yee woulde gather the true meanings, and write them in your heartes. Which when the Iews regarded not, they thought it ynough to carry the bokes in their hands: but we, let vs haue them, not in our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, but in our houſes: yea let vs, as it behoueth vs, imprinte them in our heartes. For by this means the filthy droſſe of this life being done away, we ſhal obtaine the ſweete bleſsings of the life to come.</hi> Hitherto hée. Theſe words are indéede ſomewhat long, but yet ſuche as are verye worthy to be obſerued of all perſons. And in good ſoothe it is expedient, that next after the Scriptures the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonitions alſo of the holy fathers, amongſt who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> is notable, ſhoulde be graciouſly hearde, and highly eſtéemed of all men.</p>
               <p>But it is time, that I now make an end of ſpeaking.<note place="margin">Concluſion.</note> I moſt hartily therefore pray and beſéech all perſons e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the bowels of oure Lorde and Sauioure <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee profeſſe and auaunt that we haue obtained the moſt honorable name of Chriſtians, that we woulde by all meanes poſſible indeuour oure ſelues to aunſwere to ſo holy a name and calling. And for by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this thing can not be brought to paſſe, but by the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21011:130"/>knowledge of <hi>GODS</hi> will and of the whole ſubſtaunce of Chriſtian doctrine: it is euident forſooth, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall reading and hearing of the Scriptures is verye muche requiſite and neceſſarie for al Chriſtians. Take therefore, I beſéech you, the aduertiſementes of vs hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto collected in ſuche wiſe, as by the ſame we maye haue intelligence, that you are in ſome ſorte perſwaded to buy the holy bookes, to take them in your handes, &amp; yearely once or oftner (if it maye be) to reade and pervſe them. It is an olde ſaying, that there is no <hi>longing for that which is vnknowen:</hi> and that <hi>knowledge hath no enimy, but the ignoraunt</hi> But thus it is, thou ſhalte no ſooner beginne to reade the holye Scriptures, but thou ſhalt beginne alſo to loue and imbrace them. The won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſwéeteneſſe that is in reading, thou ſhalte then firſt of all perceyue, when thou art a little envred with it. As for thoſe counterfaite reaſons, wherewith in theſe our dayes the crafty Foxes and <hi>Aegiptian</hi> inchaunters goe about to withdrawe all ſortes of men, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the common ſorte and youth of good calling from their holy and godly purpoſe, ſtoppe thou thine eares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them and paſſe them ouer as deadly Mermaides ſongs. Sathan the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> enimy of mankinde, ſléepeth not, neyther taketh anye reſte: but from time to tyme thruſteth forthe one while verily ſuche as are approued in opinion for their notable wiſedome, another while ſwiniſhe haters and contemners of all holy things, an other while Hypocrites puffed vp with a vaine ſhew of holyneſſe, and therefore maruellous fit inſtrumentes to beguile the ſimple, by whoſe painted and ſmooth perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and by other crafty conueyances the vnwarie ſort maye be broughte to the neglecting and open hatred of the Scriptures: but it is your partes, with theſe reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and inſtructions, whereof you haue hitherto heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſundry, as well out of the ſacred Scriptures the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
